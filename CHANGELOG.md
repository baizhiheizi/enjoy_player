## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **PostHog product analytics** ([#694](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/694)) with a device-global opt-out switch in Settings → About. Events cover practice, transcripts, lookup/translation, Craft, vocabulary review, subscriptions, and credits; init is manual and token-gated via `--dart-define` so tokenless builds are structurally inert, and Windows/Linux builds stay fully inert (no vendor SDK). See [ADR-0086](docs/decisions/0086-posthog-product-analytics.md) and [docs/features/analytics.md](docs/features/analytics.md).
- **Friendly credits-exhausted errors** ([#648](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/648)): Enjoy-hosted AI rejections no longer leak "HTTP 402" — every AI surface (lookup, pronounce, auto-translate, ASR, shadow-reading assessment, Craft tools, vocabulary review, purchase paths) renders one shared, localized message with the required/limit/reset details and a one-tap recovery CTA. BYOK provider 402s never show the Enjoy upsell, and repeated failures no longer stack snackbars.
- **Craft preferences are remembered** ([#670](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/670)): screen mode, translation style per mode, custom prompt, and voice per base language persist across sessions, and the language pair seeds from the learner's profile so the Express idle pill no longer shows "—". See [docs/features/craft.md](docs/features/craft.md).
- **Crafted audio cloud sync** ([#587](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/587)): Craft-generated audio binaries upload with the sync payload so they play on every signed-in device, not only the one that created them. See [ADR-0081](docs/decisions/0081-crafted-audio-cloud-sync.md).
- **Continue practicing** ([#609](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/609), [#714](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/714)): a compact sidebar rail card on desktop resumes the latest echo session (thumbnail, title, progress) and shrinks away when there is nothing to resume. Leaving the player now stops live playback instead of collapsing into a global mini player. See [ADR-0082](docs/decisions/0082-home-continue-no-mini-player.md).
- **Paper & Graphite themes** ([#616](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/616)): new light and dark themes with a System/Light/Dark preference, a shared chrome SVG icon sprite, and prototype design tokens for radii, assessment colors, and typography across shell, transport, and buttons. See [ADR-0083](docs/decisions/0083-paper-graphite-light-dark.md).

### Changed

- **Redesigned shell and player chrome**: the bottom navigation floats as a frosted-glass capsule, the global transport floats as an inset glass capsule with blur/hide moved into the CC sheet (the phone bar stays play, echo, CC, speed), the audio expanded player swaps its reserved toolbar strip for a floating collapse control, and vocabulary flashcards restyle toward the study-card design with rating buttons in a post-flip footer. The download landing page aligns with the redesigned prototype.
- **YouTube in-page efficiency** ([#662](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/issues/662)): the watch-inject style pass runs once per DOM shape behind a MutationObserver instead of re-applying ~40 inline properties every 300 ms, poster gating is observer-driven, and the poll backs off while paused.
- **Player rebuild scope and open latency** ([#663](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/issues/663), [#661](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/issues/661)): the loading-stage thumbnail resolves and decodes off the UI thread with memoization, the transport progress strip no longer allocates per paint, the buffering overlay and expanded-player chrome builder keep stable identities so parked overlays stop rebuilding the shell, and the echo-session read overlaps `engine.open` instead of serializing behind it.
- **Credits usage records** show a "Used before" column alongside Required/Used ([#690](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/690)).
- **Dead-code audit** (issue [#704](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/issues/704)): removed unused widgets, tokens, purchase flows, and API scaffolding across core, data, AI, and feature layers, and dropped the unused `cupertino_icons` and `skeletonizer` dependencies. Internal seams extracted in the same window: `MediaRegistry`, `ShadowTakeStore`, `CraftLibraryRepository`, `EnrichmentBackend`, `CompletionLoop`, one playback-highlight provider, one engine-swap mechanic, and the transcript repository split into focused part files.

### Fixed

- **YouTube play-then-pause**: playback no longer re-pauses itself right after starting. Root causes addressed across the saga ([#589](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/589), [#620](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/620), [#650](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/650)): transport commands route through the page player API and never force muted starts (Chromium's gesture lock turned muted starts + programmatic unmute into a pause), overlay parking keeps the live stage size instead of shrinking the WebView across YouTube's compact-player breakpoint (which flushed ABR), the immediate-pause auto-retry is data-gated and escalates to a second retry for the echo-mode wedge without ever auto-resuming a deliberate pause, and pause-context telemetry explains remaining cases. See [docs/features/youtube.md](docs/features/youtube.md#limitations).
- **Linux platform fixes** ([#643](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/643), [#644](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/644), [#647](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/647), [#619](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/619)): secure-storage session loss fixed with a vendored patched `flutter_secure_storage_linux` plus serialized keyring ops (sign-in no longer bounces to signed-out when the token exchange succeeded); opening YouTube no longer wedges every later audio open (the ADR-0048 opt-out gates every engine mount path, shows the "coming soon" notice, and never swaps away the live mpv engine); native Google sign-in is disabled and web-PKCE callbacks are delivered to the running instance via D-Bus single-instance forwarding. See [ADR-0084](docs/decisions/0084-linux-google-signin-off-and-pkce-deeplink.md) and [docs/features/linux-platform.md](docs/features/linux-platform.md#what-is-not-yet-available).
- **Assessment word timelines keep source orthography** (issue [#621](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/issues/621)): eSpeak word events no longer drop, duplicate, or shift displayed words (reduced function words, hyphen compounds, numeral expansions); the app's tokenizer spans are the authoritative orthography and events only contribute timing/phones, with mapping hardened for typographic apostrophes, combining marks, and non-BMP character offsets.
- **Echo mode robustness** (issue [#659](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/issues/659), [#678](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/678), [#673](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/673)): expand/shrink validate persisted line indices after a re-import re-segments the transcript, the lines cache is keyed on the transcript (not the media) so stale cues are never served, poster capture is skipped when an open restores to position 0 with echo active (it fought the enforcer and paused playback), too-narrow windows widen instead of looping seek→pause→seek, and a reset no longer seeks a stale echo target on the new engine — the clamp wait is bounded so one wedged seek can't silently disable enforcement for the session.
- **Player stability**: tapping a tile no longer fire-and-forget-disposes the live engine mid-playback (which wedged media_kit's native event pump and held later opens on the loading skeleton) ([#675](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/675)); every post-open engine command is bounded so a wedged pump can't hold the loading screen ([#651](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/651)); the launch pipeline guards against stale open generations so audio no longer keeps playing after leaving the player ([#671](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/671)); the previous session's debounced write flushes before a new open, so restored echo windows and blur flags no longer leak across media ([#669](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/669)); completion-loop replay and other engine async paths survive engine errors instead of silently killing repeat/segment-loop for the stint (issue [#658](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/issues/658), [#674](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/674)).
- **Transport scrubber** holds the optimistic seek fraction until the engine confirms, so the thumb no longer visibly snaps back on YouTube's ~250 ms command latency ([#679](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/679)).
- **YouTube metadata refresh** no longer trips Riverpod's "provider cannot depend on itself" assertion when opening from a placeholder row (issue [#676](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/issues/676), [#680](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/680)).
- **Overlapping YouTube poll ticks** no longer apply stale DOM snapshots out of order, so the transport no longer shows playing after the video has ended (issue [#655](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/issues/655), [#672](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/672)).
- **Player exit**: back navigation pops the route before teardown so the loading placeholder is no longer stranded on screen, and notice rendering no longer aborts snackbar layout mid-pop ([#645](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/645)).
- **Notices**: snackbar messages keep full width when an action is present (long zh CTAs no longer squeeze the copy into a narrow column on phones), and dismiss affordances match the SDK's 48 dp tap-target geometry ([#691](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/691)).
- **Subscription pricing**: the yearly savings badge shows only on the yearly tab ([#715](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/715)).

## [0.8.5] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- **iOS TestFlight** packages eSpeak-NG as `eSpeakNG.xcframework` instead of a naked `libespeak-ng.dylib` in `Runner.app/Frameworks/`. App Store Connect treats standalone `.dylib` files as Swift stdlibs (TN2435) and rejects the IPA with ITMS-90426 ("SwiftSupport folder is missing"). Exported IPAs are now checked for the framework, no standalone `.dylib` files, `MinimumOSVersion` 15.0, and strict signing.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- **iOS TestFlight packaging** now leaves Xcode's Embed Frameworks phase as the sole owner of copying and signing `libespeak-ng.dylib`. The custom eSpeak script no longer mutates or re-signs nested code after that phase, removes Xcode's empty iOS `Contents/Resources/` container before final signing, and prevents archive export from invalidating the app seal; exported IPAs are now checked for the eSpeak dylib, populated `SwiftSupport/iphoneos/` runtime libraries, strict signing, and `MinimumOSVersion` 15.0.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-08-18

## [0.8.1] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- **Assessment take replay** with karaoke-highlight transcript and word-clip playback for reviewing recorded takes.
- **Post-sign-in onboarding tips** highlight Craft, Import, and other key surfaces via showcaseview.
- **iOS TestFlight public beta invite** on the landing page.

### Changed

- **Whitespace normalization** shared across transcript and onboarding flows via a single helper.
- **Image network cache** swaps remaining `Image.network` for `CachedNetworkImageProvider` for steadier scrolling.

### Fixed

- **Azure TTS usage** reports `usage.tts.textLength` instead of `durationSeconds` so usage metering matches character volume (issue #544).
- **Word-clip playback** starts at the word offset instead of zero so replayed clips match the on-screen word.
- **Onboarding tips** persist the Home tip when Craft/Import is tapped from the showcase prompt.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- **Lite and Pro subscription tiers** with a unified tier catalog, credit balances, purchase flow, and paid-feature gating.
- **Immersive vocabulary flashcard review** with automatic dictionary loading for focused study sessions.
- **Practice poster sharing** from the shadow-reading recording toolbar.

### Changed

- **Transcript and echo layouts** use a more compact mobile density while preserving comfortable 16px line padding.
- **Dictionary lookup actions** are ordered Pronounce → Collect → Copy → Close for a more natural learning flow.
- **Subscription cards** use equal-height layouts and credit-first copy across the tier catalog.

### Fixed

- **YouTube playback** no longer gets stuck in repeated play-then-pause transport retries.
- **iOS App Store builds** include the camera and photo-library usage descriptions required by file-picker integrations.
- **Windows release builds** avoid MAX_PATH failures by staging builds in a short workspace path.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- **Craft history remove**: clearing a Craft history record now keeps the library audio and transcript (it clears Craft provenance instead of deleting). See [ADR-0062](docs/decisions/0062-craft-history-remove-keeps-audio.md) and [docs/features/craft.md](docs/features/craft.md#craft-history-crafthistory).
- **Craft Voice-Express dual-mode** redesign: a voice-first Express mode (speak → ASR → AI rewrite → TTS) is now the default, alongside the existing Advanced translate/synthesize tools. See [ADR-0060](docs/decisions/0060-craft-voice-express-dual-mode.md) and [docs/features/craft.md](docs/features/craft.md).
- **Word pronunciation** with shared playback control and locale resolution.
- **Craft shadow-friendly transcript cues** with Apple word-boundary timing.

### Changed

- **Community activity card** split into focused part files (`avatars`, `bodies`, `metrics`, `stats`) sharing one library scope.
- **Global transport bar** extracts `_LineNavButton` as the shared prev/next/replay control.
- **Media card** split into focused modules.
- **Craft** extracts shared `CraftLoadingView` and `CraftFailureCard`.

### Fixed

- **Enjoy modals** present above `PlayerSurfaceHost`.
- **YouTube mount** no longer notifies during build; Windows pronounce `BytesSource` path fixed.
- **Craft** merges standalone clause punctuation onto the prior word.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Auto-renew subscription** with credits packages and membership tiers.
- **Logging test infrastructure** with `TestLoggingScope` helper for asserting log output.

### Changed

- **Transcript repository** split into focused part files (auto-translate, subtitle import, YouTube fetch, worker cache).
- **NavItemPill** extracted as shared widget between sidebar and settings rail.
- **Bearer auth** acquisition centralized into `_ensureAuthenticated`.

### Fixed

- **YouTube login** no longer crashes by parking the surface host.
- **Tablet orientation** no longer mis-locked to portrait at bootstrap.
- **Android TLS** and **macOS SwiftPM** build failures resolved.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- **Phone orientation and player layout** lock phones to portrait and switch video/transcript between stacked and side-by-side from window aspect instead of a fixed width breakpoint.
- **Library** bumps recency on every open, sorts by recent activity, and defaults to the Video tab.

### Fixed

- **YouTube player overlays** pass host chrome hits through so embedded controls remain clickable.
- **Expired Pro subscriptions** correctly use the free daily credits limit.
- **Android release builds** clear stale plugin caches that could break AGP 9 packaging.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Long-form AI transcripts** now use resumable Deepgram jobs for media at least 15 minutes long, with upload progress, persisted in-flight attempts, and clearer processing feedback.

### Changed

- **Vocabulary review and echo practice** have more focused study controls and polished practice layouts.
- **Vocabulary on mobile** now prioritizes the word list, moves statistics into Review details, and collapses filters behind the toolbar.
- **Transcript empty states** use clearer AI transcript wording and actions tailored to local and remote media.

### Fixed

- **Local media reopening and sync** no longer hang after a video is deleted and imported again.
- **Player overlays**, including dictionary lookup, remain correctly positioned above video.
- **Android release builds** support current `share_plus` versions under Android Gradle Plugin 9.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Update availability badge** on Settings when a newer app version is ready.

### Changed

- **Android update prompts** now show download progress.

### Fixed

- **Transcript subtitle selection** once again offers the Auto translate option.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Vocabulary learning workflow** with transcript lookup actions, AI-enriched review cards, persisted review sessions, cloud sync, media actions, and Pro Anki CSV export.
- **Profile editing** with avatar upload and Enjoy ID support.

### Changed

- **Adaptive layouts and UI polish** across vocabulary, profile, and hotkey screens, using shared page families and gutters.
- **Vocabulary context selection** now prefers complete sentences with a bounded fallback for unpunctuated transcripts.
- **API timezone handling** now uses the device timezone reported by `flutter_timezone`.

### Fixed

- **Sync recovery** now handles duplicate catalog rows during video upload and refetches vocabulary when create responses omit `updatedAt`.
- **Keyboard navigation** dismisses shell sheets before popping routes and returns cleanly from vocabulary review on Escape.
- **Windows Azure assessment** now supports media paths containing non-ASCII characters.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- **Path-linked local media** — link durable source paths when lasting access exists, fall back to app-managed copies otherwise, and delete shared media only when unreferenced across per-user databases.

### Fixed

- **Practice poster export crash in release mode** — `RenderObject.debugNeedsPaint` throws `LateInitializationError` in release when implemented with `late`+`assert`; export waits for a settled frame, retries rasterization when needed, and resets exporting state in `finally`. See [docs/features/share-poster.md](docs/features/share-poster.md).

## [0.5.2] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Shared `LoadingIcon` widget** for inline busy affordances ([#338](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/issues/338), [#341](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/341)). A compact 18×18 `CircularProgressIndicator` (`size`, `strokeWidth`, `color`) replaces 30+ duplicated `SizedBox` + `CircularProgressIndicator` patterns across 20 files (auth sidebar chip, profile preferences, settings hub, sync status, transcript busy action, subtitle track picker, lookup refresh/error rows, cloud library body, craft translate/synthesize tools, BYOK forms, discover subscribe sheet / screen / channel filter, share poster preview, locate media, shadow-reading assessment button). Documented in [docs/features/app-ui.md § Widgets reference](docs/features/app-ui.md#widgets-reference).
- **Shared `SectionLabel` widget** for in-card section headers ([#337](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/issues/337), [#341](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/341)). Replaces the duplicate `_FormSectionLabel` / `_SpeechSectionLabel` private classes in the BYOK forms with a single public widget (`Icon` + `EnjoyThemeTokens.space8` + bold `labelLarge` text using the active `ColorScheme`). Documented in [docs/features/app-ui.md § Widgets reference](docs/features/app-ui.md#widgets-reference).

### Changed

- **Discover channel refresh uses InnerTube `browse` as primary data source** ([ADR-0047](docs/decisions/0047-youtube-discover-innertube.md)). The per-channel refresh path now tries InnerTube's anonymous `browse` endpoint first (`POST youtubei.googleapis.com/youtubei/v1/browse`) and falls back to the Atom RSS endpoint on failure. InnerTube returns richer metadata (`lengthText`, `viewCountText`, `publishedTimeText`) and is materially less likely to be blocked by YouTube's bot detection. The legacy watch-page HTML duration enrichment is skipped for InnerTube-sourced rows. Client profile rotation (`WEB` → `MWEB`) and continuation pagination (cap 5 pages ≈ 150 entries) match the caption fetcher's posture. See [docs/features/discover.md](docs/features/discover.md). *(Later superseded for feed fetch by [ADR-0051](docs/decisions/0051-youtube-worker-discovery.md) — server-side RSSHub proxy; ADR-0047 remains accurate for that slice of history.)*
- **Discover avatar URL cache rides the shared `L1Store<K, V>` primitive** ([#335](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/335)). `DiscoverRepository` no longer carries a hand-rolled `LinkedHashMap` LRU for channel avatars; the cache is now a 256-entry, 6-hour-TTL instance of the same [`L1Store`](lib/core/cache/lru_store.dart) that backs the AI result cache hierarchy ([ADR-0045](docs/decisions/0045-ai-result-cache-hierarchy.md)) and `LookupSheetResultCache`. The 6 h TTL is a strict relaxation of the previous infinite lifetime — avatar URLs change only a few times per year, so the window is far longer than realistic re-fetch cadence while bounding memory of long-running sessions that touch thousands of distinct channels. New cache call sites should use `L1Store` instead of re-implementing LRU bookkeeping; see [docs/conventions.md § Caching](docs/conventions.md#caching) for the behavior contract and current call sites.
- **`SyncDownloadService` uses a generic `_downloadEntityInternal<E>` helper** ([#336](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/issues/336), [#341](https://github.com/baizhiheizi/enjoy_player/pull/341)). The three per-entity download paths (audio, video, recording) now share one ~75-line pagination + merge loop instead of duplicating ~200 lines of triplicated cursor-paging logic. Public `downloadAudios` / `downloadVideos` / `downloadRecordings` / `downloadAllEntitiesFresh` entry points and `SyncResult` shape are unchanged — see [docs/features/sync.md](docs/features/sync.md).
- **Discover feed entry upserts run in a single Drift batch transaction per source** for lower write amplification on large channel refreshes — one `watchTimeline` emission for non-empty upserts; empty responses are a no-op. See [docs/features/discover.md § Cache semantics](docs/features/discover.md#cache-semantics-append-only).

### Fixed

- **Intermittent Windows YouTube play-then-pause startup**: WebView2 ignores `mediaPlaybackRequiresUserGesture`, while the player previously force-unmuted on HTML5's optimistic `play` event. Playback now stays muted until the authoritative `playing` event settles, transport state no longer treats `play` as proof that frames are advancing, and rejected `play()` promises plus command/event/poll transitions are captured by the `YouTube*` diagnostic loggers. The WebView logger names were also corrected from `Youtube*` to the allowlisted, case-sensitive `YouTube*` prefix, fixing pre-existing silent loss of FINE records. See [docs/features/youtube.md](docs/features/youtube.md#limitations).
- **YouTube InnerTube caption profile ladder hardening** so client-profile rotation and worker cache-only transcript fetches fail closed instead of returning empty or mismatched tracks.
- **Shadow-reading assessment restored for unknown media language** — unknown / denylisted media tags (`und`, empty) fall back to the learner's `effectiveLearningLanguage` via `resolveAzureAssessmentLocaleForPractice` / `isAzurePronunciationAssessmentSupportedForPractice` instead of disabling Assess while play / take-menu still worked. Genuinely unsupported primaries still disable the control with a tooltip (no silent `en-US` coercion). See [docs/features/shadow-reading.md](docs/features/shadow-reading.md#pronunciation-assessment-azure) and [docs/features/echo-mode.md](docs/features/echo-mode.md).
- **Discover migration v13 `feed_url` backfill** uses the SQL column name `channel_id` (not the Drift accessor `channelId`), so pre-existing subscriptions get a worker feed URL instead of failing the migration step.
- **Worker YouTube `client-profiles` wire shape parsing** aligned with the actual response body.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- **Linux platform support (AppImage)**. Linux is now a first-class supported desktop platform. ([ADR-0048](docs/decisions/0048-linux-platform-support.md))
  - `linux/` Flutter desktop scaffold, `.github/workflows/build_linux.yml` CI, `release_linux.sh`, AppImage packager
  - Centralized `lib/core/platform/linux_platform_availability.dart` predicates
  - Landing page `#card-linux` with localized strings (en + zh)
  - YouTube engine gracefully opts out on Linux (WebViewGTK not ready for v1)
  - Constitution amendment 1.1.0 → 1.2.0 (Linux added to supported targets)
  - New `docs/features/linux-platform.md`, `docs/decisions/0048-linux-platform-support.md`
  - `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` updated for Linux first-class support

- **Echo enforcement coordinator (`EchoEnforcer`)**: the reactive per-tick
  echo correction and the proactive seek clamp are now serialized through one
  single-flight coordinator, so concurrent seeks can't interleave into an
  audible stutter at segment edges. Enforcement runs on every position event,
  so pause-and-rewind fires within ~50 ms of the segment end (previously up to
  ~360 ms late, sampled on a 400 ms grid). The in-memory session + DB write
  stay on the 400 ms grid so the recorded clip window still lines up. Covered
  by boundary-timing and single-flight serialization tests. See
  [docs/features/echo-mode.md](docs/features/echo-mode.md) and issue #280.

### Changed

- **Position is now durably written mid-playback**: `PlaybackSessionPersister`
  coalesces updates on a 450 ms debounce but forces a flush once pending data
  is older than ~2 s. The 400 ms emit cadence previously re-armed the 450 ms
  debounce forever, so a crash/kill lost all progress since the last pause; the
  max-age bound makes loss rate-independent (works at 1× and 2×). Background
  flush errors are now caught + logged instead of surfacing as uncaught async
  exceptions.
- **Echo window source of truth**: enforcement re-derives start/end seconds
  from the line indices + current transcript at enforcement time (falling back
  to the cached value), so a re-segmented transcript yields fresh boundaries
  instead of stale ones. Echo-path magic numbers and s/ms conversions were
  extracted to named constants/helpers.
- **Guarded mpv teardown**: `PlayerController` disposal is now reentrancy-guarded
  and its teardown future is captured/observable, reducing the latent double-mpv
  race on a future `ref.invalidate` (Riverpod still does not await `onDispose`).

### Added

- **ASR transcript generation**: local audio and video can generate,
  re-generate, and auto-select a time-aligned `source: ai` transcript through
  the existing Enjoy, Azure BYOK, or OpenAI-compatible Whisper capability
  paths. Generated tracks upsert deterministically, propagate a detected
  language, and use localized failure feedback.
- **YouTube bilingual transcripts**: when the learner's native language differs
  from the source, the worker fetch sends a single multi-language
  `pollTranscripts({ languages: [source, native], waitMs })` request instead of
  two sequential calls. The original caption is stored as the primary track and
  the native translation as the secondary; a `partial` response logs the missing
  languages without inventing a primary from a non-existent row. See
  [ADR-0036](docs/decisions/0036-youtube-bilingual-transcripts.md) and
  [docs/features/transcript.md](docs/features/transcript.md#youtube-worker).
- Local CI gate scripts under `.github/scripts/` so contributors and agents
  can mirror the cheapest CI failures before pushing:
  - `validate_ci_gates.sh` — runs `check_dart_format` + `check_codegen_drift`
    (and optionally `flutter analyze` / `flutter test` via `--analyze`,
    `--test`, or `--all`); `--fix` auto-formats and regenerates codegen.
  - `check_dart_format.sh` — fails when `dart format` would change a file in
    `lib`, `test`, or any path package's `lib`/`test`. `--fix` writes the
    formatting.
  - `check_codegen_drift.sh` — runs `build_runner` in the root and any path
    package that declares it, then fails if generated `*.g.dart` /
    `*.freezed.dart` files drift from `HEAD`. `--fix` regenerates and leaves
    the diff to commit.
- `.githooks/pre-push` — blocks pushes that would fail CI `Dart format` and
  (when Dart/lib/package sources are in the push range) `Codegen drift`.
  Install once per clone with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`; bypass
  with `git push --no-verify`.

### Fixed

- **YouTube transcript upload payload now passes worker validation (#318)**.
  `YoutubeTranscriptsApi.uploadTranscript()` now sends the full
  worker-required body: `format: "enjoy"`, the worker-side
  `caption_fetch` derived from `source` (`official` → `official`, anything
  else → `auto`), and a `generatedAt` ISO 8601 UTC timestamp. Without these
  fields the worker's `parseTranscriptUpload()` rejects every upload, so
  client-side fetch results never populated the R2 cache. See
  [docs/features/transcript.md](docs/features/transcript.md) and
  [specs/013-client-yt-transcripts/contracts/worker-cache-api.md](specs/013-client-yt-transcripts/contracts/worker-cache-api.md).
- **`fetchClientProfiles()` now reads the worker's `profiles` envelope (#319)**.
  The client previously called `getJsonList()`, which threw on any
  non-array body; the worker actually returns `{"version", "profiles"}`.
  The client now calls `getJson()` and extracts the `profiles` list
  defensively, so `YoutubeCaptionFetcher` reaches the published client
  profiles instead of always falling back to built-in defaults.
- **Removed the dead poll-based YouTube transcript client API and the
  outdated spec 008 worker contract (#320)**. The worker has retired
  `POST /youtube/transcripts` as a poll/generate endpoint in favor of a
  cache-only contract; the legacy `pollTranscript` / `pollTranscripts`
  methods on `YoutubeTranscriptsClient` were never called by any
  production code (`TranscriptRepository` only uses `getCachedTranscript`
  and `uploadTranscript`) and are now deleted along with their unit
  tests. The 008 contract doc
  (`specs/008-youtube-bilingual-captions/contracts/youtube-transcripts-api.md`)
  is removed; in-tree references are updated to
  [`specs/013-client-yt-transcripts/contracts/worker-cache-api.md`](specs/013-client-yt-transcripts/contracts/worker-cache-api.md)
  and the same contract is now documented as the source of truth in
  [ADR-0036](docs/decisions/0036-youtube-bilingual-transcripts.md).
  `docs/features/transcript.md` is updated to describe the supported
  cache + profile endpoints rather than the retired poll path.

- **Lookup source precedence is now chrome-first**: transcript dictionary
  lookup resolves the source language from the video (chrome) language first,
  falling back to the active track language, and only then to the learning
  language — replacing the old "first sibling transcript track" heuristic. The
  pure helper `resolveLookupSourceLanguage({chromeLanguage, activeTrackLanguage})`
  is covered by 6 unit tests. See
  [ADR-0019](docs/decisions/0019-transcript-dictionary-lookup.md),
  [ADR-0042](docs/decisions/0042-multi-language-lookup-catalog.md), and
  [docs/features/dictionary-lookup.md](docs/features/dictionary-lookup.md#default-source).
- **Auto-translate keyed by primary text, not time match**: AI auto-translate
  tracks are now aligned via an index overlay plus a `sourceKey` content
  fingerprint (`normalize(plain(primary.text)) | workerLang(src) | workerLang(tgt)`),
  so a neighbor cue is no longer attached when timings are tight, and an edited
  cue no longer keeps a stale translation. See
  [ADR-0039](docs/decisions/0039-auto-translate-primary-text-keyed-overlay.md)
  and [docs/features/transcript.md](docs/features/transcript.md#auto-translate).
- **i18n: localize remaining hardcoded user-facing strings**: removed
  hidden-English hotkey fallbacks, localized shadow-reading captions and the
  file-not-found reason, replaced raw `Text('$error')` dumps with
  `errorGenericLoadFailed`, added the `authOtpInputSemantics` OTP a11y label,
  filled the missing `subtitlesRegenerate` zh translation. See
  [docs/features/auth.md](docs/features/auth.md),
  [docs/features/transcript.md](docs/features/transcript.md),
  [docs/features/shadow-reading.md](docs/features/shadow-reading.md),
  [docs/features/hotkeys.md](docs/features/hotkeys.md), and
  [docs/conventions.md](docs/conventions.md).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Wiki documentation template at `.github/agentic-wiki/PAGES.md` consumed by the
  `agentic-wiki-writer` workflow. Includes page outlines for Home, Getting
  Started, Architecture, Player, Transcripts, Library, Sync, Auth, Settings,
  Release & CI, Local Packages, and an index page for AI coding agents.
- Google Sign-In configuration files (`google-services.json` /
  `GoogleService-Info.plist`) flipped from `REPLACE_WITH_*` placeholders to
  shipped defaults; the Web application client ID is referenced from
  `kGoogleWebClientId` in `lib/features/auth/domain/google_auth_config.dart`.
- `macos/Runner/ReleaseDirect.entitlements` — separate entitlements file for
  Developer ID direct-download builds (sandbox + network + app keychain
  group, **without** `com.apple.developer.applesignin`, which is unsupported
  on Developer ID distribution).
- Dicebear SVG avatar URLs are rewritten to PNG before being handed to
  Flutter image decoders, fixing black/missing avatars in the community
  activity card, account hero, and profile sidebar.

### Changed

- Database is now strictly sign-in gated — guest rekey imports and the
  signed-out library fallback were removed in `35a2a57`. `guestAppDatabaseProvider`
  was renamed to `deviceGlobalAppDatabaseProvider` so `enjoy_player.sqlite` is
  clearly device-global settings (not a guest library). See
  [ADR-0012](docs/decisions/0012-per-user-sqlite-isolation.md) and
  [ADR-0031](docs/decisions/0031-login-only-access.md).
- macOS local/Xcode builds no longer reference `com.apple.developer.applesignin`
  (the capability is unsupported on Developer ID distribution and breaks
  provisioning on macOS). iOS still ships with the entitlement on all
  Runner configurations; macOS Direct builds use `ReleaseDirect.entitlements`
  via `notarize_release.sh`.
- `release.ps1` `--notarize` is now auto-enabled when `--publish` builds a
  macOS zip, so direct-download publish flows no longer need to pass it
  explicitly.
- `--norsrc` was added to the macOS zip `ditto` invocation in the Apple
  release CI to omit AppleDouble entries that broke framework seals when
  unzipping downstream.

### Fixed

- **Landing page store buttons**: iOS TestFlight and Android Play beta cards now stay visible when their URLs are unset in `landing/config.js`, rendering a disabled "Coming soon" button (`btn--disabled`, `aria-disabled="true"`) instead of dropping the cards or shipping a broken link. See [docs/packaging.md](docs/packaging.md#updating-store-links) and [ADR-0024](docs/decisions/0024-download-landing-page.md).
- **macOS keychain cold-start (`-34018`)**: `keychain-access-groups` was
  empty, which broke `flutter_secure_storage` in local debug builds and
  trapped the app in an auth retry loop. The app's own keychain group
  (`$(AppIdentifierPrefix)$(CFBundleIdentifier)`) is now set on Debug,
  Profile, Release, and ReleaseDirect entitlements. See
  [docs/features/auth.md](docs/features/auth.md).
- **macOS Developer ID direct-download launch (`error 163`)**: Sign in with
  Apple entitlements are unsupported on Developer ID builds; switching to
  `ReleaseDirect.entitlements` and repacking from a stapled app before
  publish unblocks notarized direct downloads on macOS 26.
- **Apple Sign-In entitlements** on iOS and macOS: `ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements`
  now ships `com.apple.developer.applesignin` referenced from all Runner
  build configurations (`CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS`) so physical devices no
  longer surface `AuthorizationError error 1000` before the API call.
- **Auth cold-start resilience**: keychain and transient network failures
  during startup are now treated as signed-out (`AuthSignedOut`) instead
  of fatal errors. `AuthCtrl.handleAuthCallbackUri` also catches any
  non-`AuthFailure` error from the token exchange and resets state, so
  the sign-in hub is no longer trapped on the "waiting for browser" pane.
- **Apple release test gate**: macOS Info.plist and Runner entitlements are
  now consistent across local Xcode and notarized release flows, so the
  release Apple workflow no longer gets blocked on missing plist keys.
- **Apple CI on self-hosted mac runners**: `.github/actions/setup-flutter`
  now installs CocoaPods and the iOS toolchain on the self-hosted mac
  runner so `build_apple.yml` and `release_apple.yml` can run end-to-end
  without manual `pod install`.
- **Skipped-frame skeleton crash**: skeleton list placeholders no longer
  crash inside nested scroll views when the parent scroll view computes
  a negative scroll offset during initial layout.
- **Drift `ADD COLUMN` migrations are now idempotent**: `_addColumnIfMissing`
  short-circuits when the column already exists, so downgrading and
  re-upgrading the schema no longer hangs the database open.
- **Blank-window hang after a failed migration**: combined with the
  idempotent ADD COLUMN fix above, the database opens even when the on-disk
  schema includes columns added by a newer build.
- **Local DB recovery paths**: `RecoverySurface` and `performRecoveryReset`
  now point at the correct per-user / device-global database files and
  the in-place reset flow is wired into the recovery UI for the user that
  needs it (with a downgrade-safe migration test). See
  [docs/features/local-database-recovery.md](docs/features/local-database-recovery.md).
- **`TranscriptRepository.watchTracks` re-emissions**: identical watch
  emissions are now deduped with `Stream.distinctBy(_listEqualsTranscriptTrack)`
  so the always-mounted transport bar stops rebuilding on no-op Drift
  ticks (#208). Mirrors the same fix already applied to `watchLines`.
- **Apple Info.plist placeholder URL scheme** is now a valid reversed host
  format (`com.googleusercontent.apps.REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT_ID`) so iOS
  bundle validation stops rejecting the binary before Google Sign-In
  configuration can be completed.

### Security

- Sign in with Apple entitlement is no longer included in the macOS
  ReleaseDirect entitlements (unsupported on Developer ID distribution);
  this narrows the entitlement set for direct-download macOS builds.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- `findSliverIndexByPrefixedId<T>` in `lib/core/utils/sliver_key_index.dart` — shared `findChildIndexCallback` lookup for sliver grids/lists keyed by a `"$prefix${id}"` `ValueKey<String>`.
- `ArtworkPalette` now has value-equality on its four `Color` fields so `Map<ArtworkPalette, ...>` use sites and `==` checks behave like data classes. `@visibleForTesting` cache seams on `lib/core/theme/dynamic_color/artwork_palette.dart`: `debugResetArtworkPaletteCache`, `debugArtworkPaletteCacheSize`, `debugArtworkPaletteCacheContainsPath`, `debugLookupArtworkPalette`, `debugPutArtworkPalette`. 12 tests in `test/core/theme/artwork_palette_test.dart` cover the new invalidation contract.

### Changed

- Home recents grid, discover merged feed grid, and channel feed grid use stable per-row `ValueKey`s + `findChildIndexCallback` so a Drift re-emit or RSS refresh no longer rebuilds every visible tile.
- **Artwork palette LRU cache key**: switched from thumbnail path alone to `(path, size, mtime)`. The in-process LRU in `extractArtworkPalette` re-`stat`s the file on every lookup and evicts any prior entry for the same path whose `(size, mtime)` no longer matches the live stat. LRU cap stays at 32 entries. ADR-0007 updated to describe the new key shape and invalidation contract.

### Fixed

- Documented the `POST /youtube/transcripts` polling contract (request body, attempt/delay budget, `forceRefresh` semantics, and outcome handling) — no behavior change, closes a docs gap between `YoutubeTranscriptsApi` and `docs/features/transcript.md`.
- **Artwork palette stale-cache leak**: re-thumbnailing or rewriting the local artwork file in place used to return the cached palette for the previous bytes because the LRU key was the path string only. Keyed by `(path, size, mtime)` so a regenerate-then-reopen cycle extracts a fresh palette.
- **Windows deep links**: PKCE sign-in callbacks no longer spawn a stray second window. The installer-registered `enjoyplayer://` protocol previously launched a fresh `enjoy_player.exe` per click; that process had no in-memory PKCE state, so the original window was stuck waiting and a second window was left open. `windows/runner/main.cpp` now detects an already-running instance via `FindWindow(L"FLUTTER_RUNNER_WIN32_WINDOW", L"Enjoy Player")`, forwards the URI to it through `app_links`'s `SendAppLink` (`WM_COPYDATA`), restores/foregrounds that window, and exits. See [docs/features/auth.md](docs/features/auth.md#deep-links-pkce-callback).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- NotFoundScreen fallback route for unknown go_router locations (en/zh/zh-CN localized).
- GitHub issue templates (`bug`, `feature`, `chore`) and a PR template at `.github/`.
- `PlayerEngine.supportsSubtitleDisabling` to skip the no-op `disableRenderedSubtitles` await on YouTube opens.
- `kPositionBucketSessionEmitMs`, `kPositionBucketDisplayMs`, `kPositionBucketScrubberMs` constants in `lib/features/player/application/position_buckets.dart` consolidating three previously inline quantization values.
- `SyncMissingUpdatedAtError` thrown by `SyncUploadService` when the server omits `updatedAt`, preserving local `serverUpdatedAt` instead of silently bumping it to `DateTime.now()`.
- Redesigned **Settings** hub with search, a two-pane layout, and default-collapsed sections; inline Account profile card in the two-pane layout.
- Developer contact bottom sheet from the About section.

### Changed

- `lib/main.dart` wraps the entire bootstrap in `runZonedGuarded` and installs `FlutterError.onError` + `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError` so framework errors are routed through the diagnostic log pipeline instead of crashing silently.
- `PlayerController.openMedia` catches exceptions from `engine.open` and downstream awaits so a failed open no longer leaves `state` pointing at a phantom session.
- `PlayerController.clear()` flushes the pending `PlaybackSessionPersister` write before cancelling, so swipe-to-dismiss no longer loses the last 450 ms of position updates.
- `YoutubePlayerEngine._emitBuffering(false)` only bumps `mountTick` on the first buffering→false transition per open, reducing ad-reload flicker.
- `_userSessionDatabases` in `app_database_provider.dart` is a bounded `LinkedHashMap` (cap = 2) — oldest entry is closed before inserting a new one.
- `SecureTokenStore` now pins `AndroidOptions()` (v10 RSA-OAEP / AES-GCM with auto-migration from legacy ciphers) and `IOSOptions(accessibility: KeychainAccessibility.first_unlock)`.
- `EmailEntryScreen` BackButton always calls `cancelSignIn()` (it was previously gated on `AuthAwaitingOtp`).
- `_EnjoyAppState.build` uses `ref.listen` to mirror `appPreferencesCtrlProvider` into `_lastResolvedPrefs` via `setState` instead of writing the field as a build-time side effect.

### Fixed

- `VideoPosterCaptureService` seek-zero restore failures now log at warning level (was a nested empty `catch` that swallowed real errors).
- Drift `transcript_fetch_states` missing index — see follow-up.
- Auth deep-link stream subscription now stored + cancelled in `dispose()`; `getInitialLink()` has an `onError` handler.
- `YoutubePlayerEngine.idleAfterClear()` removed a dead branch where `_videoId.isNotEmpty` was checked after `_videoId = ''`.
- Two `kIsWeb` branches removed from `log_file_sink.dart` and `practice_poster_export.dart` per AGENTS.md hard rule.
- Library empty state now shows insight cards alongside the empty-state illustration on the home screen.

### Security

- ADR-0028 accepted: agentic workflows route inference through the MiniMax proxy with CI egress allow-list checks; zero-retention posture pending annual re-verification (medium risk).

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- YouTube player WebView: unblock Windows release playback (CDN subresource navigation policy).
- YouTube player WebView: harden cross-platform playback recovery after renderer crashes and stalls.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- Local production diagnostics logging and zip export.

### Changed

- YouTube player: poster overlay and warm WebView on init.

### Fixed

### Added

- Public download landing page at [get.enjoy.bot](https://get.enjoy.bot) with platform detection, i18n, and feature showcase.
- Cloudflare Pages deploy workflow for the landing site.
- Discover UI tests (horizontal drag scroll, subscription actions).

### Changed

- Discover subscribe sheet: keyboard handling, state management, and layout improvements.
- Discover: horizontal drag scroll behavior; clearer subscription error handling.
- Android: flavor handling docs and build config; JNI merge cache workaround.

### Fixed

- Release publish pipeline: pubspec-versioned artifacts, per-platform `latest.json` overwrites, and macOS release fixes.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Transcript **recording counts** per line; hotkey **settings** screen and global focus policy.
- **Mobile transport** line navigation for narrow player layouts.
- Signed-in **Home**: today's practice goal and community activity cards.

### Changed

- Library search with `/` hotkey; improved media card thumbnails and YouTube artwork handling.
- Release tooling: shared local/CI scripts, R2 publish pipeline, and local-first packaging docs.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-22

First public beta.

### Added

- Initial MVP scaffold: feature-first layout, Drift schema, media_kit player, Riverpod providers, go_router shell with mini player, transcript import (SRT/VTT), echo mode parity with web `echo-utils`.
- Documentation system: AGENTS.md, ADRs, feature specs, Cursor rules.
