# Native eSpeak-NG artifacts

Production alignment loads **libespeak-ng** and a trimmed **espeak-ng-data**
tree at runtime (`DynamicLibrary.open`). Nothing here is compiled during
`flutter test`.

## Layout

```text
native/
  android/arm64-v8a/libespeak-ng.so
  android/armeabi-v7a/libespeak-ng.so
  android/x86_64/libespeak-ng.so
  ios/libespeak-ng.dylib            # iphoneos arm64 (wrap source)
  ios/libespeak-ng.simulator.dylib  # iphonesimulator arm64 + x86_64
  ios/eSpeakNG.xcframework          # App Store embed (TN2435)
  macos/libespeak-ng.dylib          # universal: arm64 + x86_64
  windows/libespeak-ng.dll
  linux/libespeak-ng.so             # x86_64
  espeak-ng-data/                   # voices + phoneme tables for focus languages
```

A missing library or data directory is not a test failure for the app suite:
production `align` / `alignSegments` return `spokenReferenceUnavailable`.
The package's own eSpeak FFI tests (golden, native phonemize, fr-CA voice)
run **unconditionally** on host platforms that have a vendored binary — a
load failure there is a regression, not a skip.

## Provenance (eSpeak-NG 1.52.0, GPL-3.0)

| Platform | Artifact | Built from the official 1.52.0 source with |
|---|---|---|
| windows | `libespeak-ng.dll` (x64) | official eSpeak-NG 1.52.0 MSI |
| linux | `libespeak-ng.so` (x86_64) | zig cc 0.15.2 `-target x86_64-linux-gnu.2.31`; requires glibc ≥ 2.29; links only libc/libm |
| macos | `libespeak-ng.dylib` (arm64 + x86_64, min 10.15) | zig cc 0.15.2 against the MacOSX11.3 SDK; links only libSystem |
| android | `libespeak-ng.so` (arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86_64) | Android NDK r27d, API 26, `-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384` (Play 16 KB page requirement); links only libc/libm/libdl |
| ios | `eSpeakNG.xcframework` (iphoneos arm64 + iphonesimulator arm64/x86_64, min 15.0) wrapped from `libespeak-ng.dylib` | Xcode clang against the iPhoneOS / iPhoneSimulator SDKs; links only libSystem. Rebuild: `native/build_ios.sh` (also runs `wrap_ios_framework.sh`). A naked `.dylib` in `Runner.app/Frameworks/` is rejected by App Store Connect (ITMS-90426, TN2435). |

All builds compile the same upstream sources (`src/libespeak-ng/*.c` except
`sPlayer.c`, plus `src/ucd-tools/src/{case,categories,ctype,proplist,
scripts,tostring}.c`) with `-fvisibility=hidden -DLIBESPEAK_NG_EXPORT`
(same export discipline as the upstream Windows build), no pcaudiolib, no
speech-player. Rebuilds should keep the 1.52.0 tag and the focus-language
data tree below in lockstep.

Android app builds merge the per-ABI libraries via the app's jniLibs source
(`android/app/build.gradle.kts` points at `native/android/`, whose `<abi>/`
subfolders are exactly the jniLibs shape), and the app pubspec bundles
`espeak-ng-data/` **and** `espeak-ng-data/lang/` as Flutter assets (Flutter
does not recurse directory entries). At startup
`lib/core/platform/espeak_android_provisioner.dart` reads
`applicationInfo.nativeLibraryDir` over the `ai.enjoy.player/espeak` channel,
extracts the data assets into app-support storage (revision-marked,
idempotent), and pins both paths via `setEspeakNativePathOverrides`. Anything
missing keeps the package fail-closed (`spokenReferenceUnavailable`).

macOS app builds copy the host dylib into `Contents/Frameworks/`. iOS
embeds `eSpeakNG.xcframework` (not a naked dylib) via Xcode Embed
Frameworks. Both copy the trimmed data tree into
`Contents/Resources/espeak-ng-data` (macOS) or `Runner.app/espeak-ng-data`
(iOS) via `bundle_into_app.sh`. Package tests
assert both layouts include `lang/en-us` (and every mapped voice) and can
phonemize English; Apple CI greps the compiled `.app`. Production
`align` resolves those bundle paths from `Platform.resolvedExecutable`
when the process is not sitting in the source tree.

## Voices (focus catalog)

`en-us`, `en-gb`, `ja`, `ko`, `es`, `es-419`, `fr-fr`, `fr-ca`, `nb` — see
`lib/src/language_map.dart`. Each mapped id must have a `lang/` file.
Do not silently substitute another voice. `fr-ca` is a Canadian French
variant on the French dictionary (eSpeak-NG 1.52 ships `fr` / `fr-be` /
`fr-ch` only).

### Norwegian Bokmål is `lang/nb` + `no_dict`

eSpeak-NG names the Norwegian Bokmål **voice** `nb` but keeps the Norwegian
phoneme table and dictionary under the `no` macrolanguage — the generated voice
file declares `phonemes no` / `dictionary no` (plus `language nb` /
`language no`). So `nb_dict` does not exist upstream: **`no_dict` is the file
that must be vendored.** Upstream ships the voice at `lang/gmq/nb`; this tree
flattens it to `lang/nb` like every other voice (upstream `lang/gmw/en-US` →
vendored `lang/en-us`).

`phondata` / `phonindex` / `phontab` / `intonations` in this tree are
byte-identical to a **full** eSpeak-NG 1.52.0 build and already contain every
language's phoneme table, so adding a language needs no recompilation of those
compiled tables — only the `lang/` voice file and the matching `*_dict`.
Regenerate them from the 1.52.0 tag (`./configure && make`, then take
`espeak-ng-data/lang/gmq/<code>` and `espeak-ng-data/<dict>_dict`).
