/// One owner for the YouTube immediate-pause play-retry protocol (issue #665).
///
/// The play-then-pause saga is the most-changed logic in the codebase, and its
/// budget used to be spread across four places that had to move in lockstep:
/// latch fields in `YoutubeSession`, the D8/D9 decision tables in
/// `transport_decisions.dart` (`decideImmediatePauseRetry`,
/// `decideTransportToggleLatch`), the `PauseStreaking` arm of
/// `YoutubeWebViewPollLoop`, and the recent-retry suppression in the audible
/// policy's `_healPostRestorePause`. The protocol's state, its constants, its
/// clock, and both decisions now live here; the callers keep only their side
/// effects (re-issuing play, surfacing the recovery hint, and arming or
/// consuming through the session's transition verbs).
///
/// ## D8 — the one-shot immediate-pause budget, its fulfilment clock, and
/// escalation
///
/// A pause confirmed almost immediately after playback started is usually the
/// page player state machine "correcting" a freshly started video back to
/// paused before it settles; one retry after it settles recovers without UX.
///
/// The budget spans the WHOLE attempt: arming ([beginUserPlay], from a
/// play-intent command) → the first `playing`
/// ([notePlayingTransition] deliberately keeps it armed — a play is only
/// fulfilled once playback outlives the immediate-pause window, which is
/// exactly the window the page's correction lands in) → consumption (the
/// retry itself — [consumeBudget] —, a rejecting/error transition
/// ([noteUserPlayUnresolved]), end of media ([noteEnded]), or any explicit
/// pause-intent command ([noteUserPauseCommand], so a deliberate app pause is
/// never auto-resumed)). Fulfilment is enforced lazily by [userPlayInFlight]:
/// the budget retires [playAttemptExpiry] after the playing episode that
/// resolved the arming command — keyed to THAT episode, not to whatever
/// episode is current, so a later page-UI resume the app never commanded
/// cannot revive a stale budget. There is deliberately no timer: the budget is
/// retired lazily on read, so fake-async widget tests never see a pending
/// timer from an armed budget.
///
/// Coverage has two arms:
///
/// - the budget above;
/// - escalation — [lastPlayingFromAutoRetry] with [autoRetriesIssued] <
///   [maxAutoRetries] — for the field-observed echo-mode wedge (Android): the
///   page re-paused the *retried* play too (~600 ms in), spending the one-shot
///   budget and wedging playback until a manual tap. Each attempt outlived the
///   previous one, so further settled retries have a real chance; the cap
///   bounds total auto-plays per user command so a deliberate pause is never
///   fought indefinitely.
///
/// Every other confirmed pause surfaces normally (the recovery hint is the
/// consumer's decision).
///
/// Irreducible tradeoff: a DOM `pause` carries no initiator, so a pause made
/// through YouTube's own in-page controls within the window of an
/// app-commanded start is indistinguishable from a page correction and is
/// retried once — self-limiting, since the budget is then spent.
///
/// ## D9 — what a transport toggle did to the budget
///
/// Classified from the direction the DOM actually took — the value returned by
/// the atomic playOrPause script — never from session `playing` state: pause
/// confirmation lags DOM pauses by ~750 ms, so session state can read opposite
/// to the command really issued during exactly the windows where the latch
/// matters (a page-corrected pause, or the D8 retry's own play).
///
/// ## Clock
///
/// All three budgets (immediate-pause window, attempt expiry, retry recency)
/// read the injected monotonic [MonotonicClock]. They used to be
/// `DateTime.now()` deltas, which an NTP step or a manual clock change could
/// corrupt in either direction.
