///
/// - the in-flight await is **cancelable**: [bump] completes a `Completer`
///   that the pending `engine.completed` await races, rather than letting it
///   drain (a completion stream may simply never fire again after a seek);
/// - the "a loop is running" marker is keyed *by generation*
///   ([_activeLoopGen]), not by op identity, so a loop that is mid-drain
///   cannot block [arm] for the new stint.
///
/// This is the **single consumer** of [PlayerEngine.completed] for repeat
/// policy — engine-internal poll loops (e.g. YouTube) only surface the
/// end-of-media transition and never decide the repeat action themselves.
