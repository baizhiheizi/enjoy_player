///
/// Only mechanics live here. *Policy* stays at the call sites — whether a swap
/// is allowed at all, which generation guards apply around each await, and
/// what must happen before MediaKit may allocate mpv:
///
/// - [ensureEngineForPlayableSource] runs the full open-path choreography:
///   install + bump, let the host drop the old stage, wait for the prior
///   surface to detach, settle, discard the old engine without awaiting it,
///   prepare the native backend, bump again.
/// - `PlayerController.warmYoutubeSurface` installs only when there is no
///   engine at all and never calls [discardWithoutAwaiting] — that is what
///   makes its "must never dispose a live / parked MediaKit engine" rule true
///   by construction rather than by an assertion in the call site.
/// - [replaceWedgedLocalEngine] installs a replacement for a wedged local
///   engine and discards the wedged one unawaited.
