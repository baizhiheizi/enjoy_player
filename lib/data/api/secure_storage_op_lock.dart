/// `flutter_secure_storage`'s Linux backend keeps **all keys in one libsecret

/// read-modify-write of that whole blob. Its sync libsecret calls pump the
/// GTK main loop while they wait on D-Bus, so a platform-channel call issued
/// by another async flow is dispatched *re-entrantly* inside the first
/// call's wait. Two overlapping writers then read the same snapshot and the
/// second store clobbers the first — mid-sign-in that erases the tokens that
/// were just written, every subsequent read returns `null`, and the 401
/// cascade signs the user out of a login the server actually accepted.
/// Overlapping creates also make gnome-keyring collide on the item
/// (`asked to register item … but it's already registered`) and can leave
/// the item corrupted (garbled `xdg:schema` attribute, empty secret).
///
/// Chaining every operation behind one [Future] keeps a single storage
/// operation in flight at a time, which makes the blob's read-modify-write
/// atomic from the backend's point of view.
