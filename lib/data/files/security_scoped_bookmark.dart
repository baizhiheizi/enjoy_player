/// Dart-side bridge to `macos/Runner/SecurityScopedBookmarkChannel.swift`.
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// Enjoy Player's macOS build is sandboxed with only
/// `com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write`. `NSOpenPanel` grants
/// a *temporary* security-scoped URL: it covers the picked file for the
/// current process only and is gone by the next launch. Without help,
/// `mk.Player.open(localUri)` (libmpv / libffmpeg) gets `EACCES` and the UI
/// gets stuck on a loading spinner.
///
/// The fix is a security-scoped bookmark: capture
/// `URL.bookmarkData(options: .withSecurityScope, …)` while the implicit
/// `NSOpenPanel` scope is still alive, persist the bytes next to the local
/// file URI, and on every open resolve them + `startAccessingSecurity…`.
///
/// ## Platform behavior
///
/// * **macOS**: real `MethodChannel` (`enjoy.player/security_scoped_bookmark`)
///   handled by `SecurityScopedBookmarkChannel.swift`.
/// * **iOS / Android / Windows / Web / Tests**: no native handler is
///   registered, so `invokeMethod` throws `MissingPluginException` and
///   every method here returns `null` / no-op. Library import on those
///   platforms keeps working unchanged — they either don't need bookmarks
///   or will adopt the same pattern behind a per-platform shim later.
///
/// ## Lifecycle invariant
///
/// `resolveBookmark` returns a `token` that MUST be paired with
/// `releaseBookmark` once the player is done with the file (i.e. before
/// the next `open()` or on engine `dispose`). Failure to pair the calls
/// leaks sandbox extensions and will eventually block subsequent
/// `startAccessing…` from succeeding on that URL.
///
/// See ADR-0060.
