## Why Enjoy Player

**Learn with content you actually enjoy.** Bring your own MP4s and audio files, or paste any YouTube URL — TED talks, Netflix shows, podcasts, anime. The transcript follows your media, not the other way around.

**Speak from day one.** Echo mode listens to a single line, records you reading it back, then scores your pronunciation on accuracy, fluency, completeness and prosody. You don't need a language partner to practise.

**Vocabulary that actually sticks.** Highlight any word in the transcript and get an instant translation, dictionary definition and an LLM-powered explanation of what the phrase means in this scene. One tap saves it to a spaced-repetition deck that reviews on the schedule your brain needs.

**One app, every device.** Native builds for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS. Library, progress, vocabulary and settings follow you everywhere, with optional cloud sync.

**Stay in the game.** A daily practice goal, a community of learners practising alongside you, and progress stats that show you're getting better — one cue at a time.

## Core features

- **Interactive transcripts** — Auto-synced subtitles from `.srt` / `.vtt` imports, AI transcription or YouTube captions. Tap any line to jump; tap any word to look it up.
- **Echo mode (shadow reading)** — Listen, record, replay. The player pauses at the end of your echo segment and rewinds, so you can drill the same line again without breaking flow.
- **Pronunciation assessment** — Native Azure speech scoring per take: overall score plus accuracy / completeness / fluency / prosody, with per-word detail and replay.
- **Dictionary & contextual translation** — Highlight text in the transcript → translation, dictionary entry, and an LLM-generated "what does this phrase mean here?" explanation.
- **Spaced-repetition vocabulary** — 3-button flashcards (Don't know / Know / Know well) on a 3-rating SM-2 schedule, with multi-context per word and Anki CSV export (Pro).
- **YouTube playback** — Paste a URL and play. Enjoy caches captions, fetches metadata and renders the transcript alongside — no ads, no autoplay surprises.
- **Pitch contour analysis** — Compare your recorded take's intonation against the original line on a YIN-pitch chart. See exactly where your tone drifts.
- **Practice poster** — Turn a shadow-reading take into a branded 9:16 poster (cover frame, hero line, stats) and share it to WeChat, X or anywhere.
- **AI auto-translate** — Per-line translations on demand, cached locally, refreshed automatically when the source text changes.
- **Cross-device sync** — Library, progress, vocabulary and settings sync across every device signed in to your Enjoy account.
