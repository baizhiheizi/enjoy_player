# Install Linux build packages only when missing (self-hosted runners).
#
# On the shared gh-sr agentic runner pool, most of these are now baked into
# the container image at build time via `container_runner_image.extra_apt_packages`
# in runners.yml, so this should normally be a fast no-op there. Kept as a
# safety net for any Linux runner (agentic image rebuild pending, or a plain
# native host) where a package isn't baked in yet.
