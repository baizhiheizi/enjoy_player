# Feature: Player

## MVP behavior

- `PlayerController` owns playback via injectable `PlayerEngine` (production: `MediaKitPlayerEngine` wrapping a single `mk.Player`, ADR-0003). Open flow is split for clarity:
  - [`resolvePlaybackOpen`](../../lib/features/player/application/playback_open_resolver.dart) — loads rows + `PlayableSource`, throws `MediaNeedsRelocateException` when needed.
  - [`ensureEngineForPlayableSource`](../../lib/features/player/application/player_engine_binding.dart) — swaps MediaKit vs YouTube engine and bumps `playerEngineRevProvider`.
  - [`schedulePlayerOpenSideEffects`](../../lib/features/player/application/player_open_side_effects.dart) — cloud transcript fetch + recording pull when signed in.
  - [`VideoPosterCaptureService`](../../lib/features/player/application/video_poster_capture_service.dart) — optional JPEG poster capture + Drift thumbnail update.
- Restores position + echo flags from `echo_sessions`.
- Debounced persistence via `PlaybackSessionPersister`; embedded subtitle discovery via `EmbeddedTrackSync`.
- `PlayerUi` tracks chrome mode (mini vs expanded) for expand/collapse side effects; route `/player/:id` still drives most visible chrome. Playing/buffering come from `playerIsPlayingProvider` / `playerIsBufferingProvider` (stream providers over the engine, each seeded with `Player.state` so the transport bar matches the engine immediately after route changes).
- Re-opening `/player/:mediaId` while that media is already the active session does **not** call `openUri` again (avoids restarting playback when expanding from the mini player).
- **Video library poster**: when a `VideoRow` has no `http(s)` `thumbnail_url` and no readable local thumbnail file, after open `VideoPosterCaptureService` may capture a JPEG via `PlayerEngine.screenshot` (`image/jpeg`) and write `media_thumbs/<key>.jpg`, then patch Drift (see `library.md`). Remote artwork URLs are never overwritten. If the temporary seek used to grab the frame fails to restore back to position zero afterward, that failure is logged at **WARNING** with the grep-friendly message `video poster capture failed to restore seek-zero position` (previously a nested empty `catch` silently swallowed it).
- **Synced local-only media**: If metadata was synced from another device but this machine has no trusted file at `localUri` (missing, or size/mtime trust check fails), and the row has a content fingerprint (`md5` column — SHA-256 hex), opening the player shows **Locate media file**. The user picks the same file; the app links or copies it only when the hash matches, then updates `localUri` / trust metadata and enqueues a sync update. See [ADR-0050](../decisions/0050-path-linked-local-media.md).
- **Shell**: `EnjoyBottomNav` on compact widths, `AppSidebar` from ~900px + mini player; nav chrome is hidden on `/player/*` for focus.
- **Wide layout** (`VideoPlayerLayout`): when width **>** `breakpointTranscriptSideBySide` (720), video and transcript are **side-by-side** (portrait-wide tablets included). Below that breakpoint, **stacked** video (16:9 stage) over transcript. Draggable split: transcript column min **360** logical px (capped at 50% width); split width is **persisted** in player preferences (`splitPx`). Transcript panel uses a subtle **1px** left border on the zinc surface; video stage is letterboxed on black with **top SafeArea** padding on the narrow stacked layout. **Tap the local video stage** to toggle play/pause (same affordance as YouTube’s embedded player); YouTube taps stay on the WebView and are not intercepted.
- **Expanded video (narrow)**: while actively playing (not buffering), there is no reserved `AppBar` height; when **paused or buffering**, back/title/YouTube login chrome is drawn in a **top overlay** (same gradient as before) so the 16:9 stage does not shift. Audio still uses a normal `AppBar` when paused (title + back).
- Echo enforcement uses `lib/features/player/domain/echo_window.dart` (ported from web). The two enforcement paths — the reactive per-tick correction and the proactive seek clamp — are serialized through a single [`EchoEnforcer`](../../lib/features/player/application/echo_enforcer.dart) coordinator (one in-flight seek/pause at a time, so they can't interleave into a stutter). Enforcement runs on every position event so the segment-end pause-and-rewind fires within ~50 ms of the boundary; the in-memory session + DB write stay on the 400 ms bucket. Echo tick correction is itself a pure function — see [Decision reducers (D1–D7)](#decision-reducers-d1d7) below.

### Decision reducers (D1–D7)

Inline transport decisions live as **pure-function reducers** in [`lib/features/player/domain/transport_decisions.dart`](../../lib/features/player/domain/transport_decisions.dart), following the precedent set by [`decideEchoPlaybackTime` / `EchoPlaybackDecision`](../../lib/features/player/domain/echo_window.dart). Each reducer takes only its inputs and returns a sealed-class result; side effects (seek/play/emit/log) stay in the single imperative consumer that `switch`es over the sealed type. Keeping the logic out of widget / controller methods means every branch is unit-tested without a running engine.

| # | Reducer | Returns | Consumer | Purpose |
|---|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| D1 | `decideSeekRouting({echoActive})` | `SeekRoutingDecision` (`throughEcho` / `direct`) | `PlayerController.seekTo` | Route user seeks through the single-flight `EchoEnforcer` when echo is active so a user seek can't interleave with reactive per-tick enforcement. |
| D2 | `decideTeardownPath({isYoutubeEngine})` | `TeardownPathDecision` (`idleAfterClear` / `stop`) | `PlayerController.clear` | YouTube keeps the WebView alive across clear (idle); native engines are fully stopped. |
| D3 | `decideReplayTarget({echoActive, echoStartTimeSeconds, activeLineStartSeconds})` | `ReplayTargetDecision` (`echoStart(time)` / `lineStart(time)`) | `PlayerInteractions.replayLine` | Replay jumps to the echo window start when echo is active, otherwise to the line containing the current time. |
| D4 | `decideProgressSeekTime({fraction, durationSeconds})` | `ProgressSeekDecision` (`valid(time)` / `invalid`) | `PlayerInteractions.seekFromFraction` | Convert a `[0,1]` strip drag into a clamped seek target; `invalid` when duration is zero / unknown. |
| D5 | `decideYouTubePlayRestart({playbackCompleted})` | `YouTubePlayRestartDecision` (`restart` / `resume`) | `YoutubePlayerEngine.play` | Reload the watch page when the previous play completed; otherwise issue JS `play()`. |
| D6 | `decidePollTransition({jsEnded, jsPaused, playing, pausedPollStreak, pauseConfirmThreshold, playbackCompleted})` | `PollTransitionDecision` (`MediaJustEnded` / `PauseStreaking` / `PollPlaying` / `PollIdleTick`) | `YoutubeWebviewPollLoop` | Reduce the raw JS poll tick + session state into the next transport transition, including streak-based pause confirmation. |
| D7 | `decideOnMediaEnd({repeatMode})` | `MediaEndDecision` (`stop` / `loop` / `loopSegment`) | `PlayerController._runCompletionLoop` | Maps `RepeatMode.{none,single,segment}` to the next action consumed by the deterministic completion loop (see ADR-0044 below). |

When adding a new transport decision, put it in `transport_decisions.dart` next to its neighbours; do **not** branch inline in the controller or engine. Companion unit tests live in [`test/features/player/transport_decisions_test.dart`](../../test/features/player/transport_decisions_test.dart) (one test per branch, including the `EchoClamp` / NaN-guard cases for `decideEchoPlaybackTime`).

- **Deterministic end-of-media handling (ADR-0044)**: `PlayerEngine.completed` is surfaced through both engines (MediaKit forwards mpv's `completed`; YouTube synthesizes from the `<video>` `ended` event / poll loop at ~250 ms resolution). `PlayerController` runs a deterministic await-completion loop guarded by a `_playbackGen` counter (same pattern as `EchoEnforcer._epoch` / `_openGeneration`) so duplicate, late, or stale `completed` events are no-ops. The loop's `RepeatMode` switch reads its next action from `decideOnMediaEnd` (D7 above):
  - `none` → `StopAtEnd` (media is at the end; user can press play to restart).
  - `single` → `LoopMedia` (seek to zero, play, re-await — loops the whole file).
  - `segment` → `LoopSegment` (seek to echo window start, play, re-await — only when echo is active; falls back to `none`).

## Presentation

- **Global transport** — composed from [`presentation/widgets/transport/`](../../lib/features/player/presentation/widgets/transport/) (progress strip, volume popover, artwork/meta, CC, fullscreen, play ring). [`GlobalTransportBar`](../../lib/features/player/presentation/widgets/global_transport_bar.dart) wires Riverpod + routing only. Playback speed opens an **Enjoy** bottom sheet (`showEnjoySheet` + drag handle) rather than a stock `PopupMenuButton`. When the user is **not** on `/player/...` (collapsed shell / “mini” transport), **swipe down** on the bar dismisses it: stops playback via `PlayerController.clear()`, resets `PlayerUi`, and clears the active session. On **narrow** mini layouts, tapping a **neutral area** of the controls row (the space between control clusters — not on a button or the seek strip) expands to the full player via [`openPlayerRoute`](../../lib/core/routing/player_navigation.dart); this is wrapped in [`EnjoyTappableSurface`](../../lib/core/interaction/enjoy_tappable.dart) so it works even at widths where the expand icon itself has been dropped. The affordance is absent on the `/player/...` route (already expanded).
- **Line-level transport** — previous line, next line, replay line, and echo mode are disabled when there is no primary transcript (empty or still loading); the echo button stays enabled while echo mode is active so the user can exit echo without transcript lines. On **narrow layouts** (≤720px), the five practice controls — **play/pause, echo, blur, subtitle (cc), speed** — are always shown and never dropped for width; **replay** is omitted from the bar (tap the active transcript line or use hotkeys). When width is still tight, controls drop in the order **previous → next → volume** (previous before next, both before volume; previous and next are independently droppable because tapping a transcript line also jumps). The desktop-video fullscreen button is the highest-priority droppable (last to drop); the expand icon is the lowest-priority droppable. The visible control set is computed by the pure [`resolveNarrowTransportBudget`](../../lib/features/player/presentation/widgets/global_transport_bar.dart) function from the live width (LayoutBuilder), so it updates immediately on rotation/resize.
- **Expanded player** — [`ExpandedPlayerChromeBody`](../../lib/features/player/presentation/expanded_player_widgets.dart) + loading/error bodies; YouTube account affordance uses [`playerYoutubeLoginChromeSupportedProvider`](../../lib/features/player/application/player_engine_capabilities_provider.dart) so UI does not depend on concrete engine types. Local video uses [`playerEngineProvider`](../../lib/features/player/application/player_engine_provider.dart) for the active engine (same instance as the controller’s engine, including test doubles).

## Engine contract (ADR-0015)

- `PlayerEngine` continues to expose **`buildVideoStage`** alongside transport commands so YouTube can keep a **single long-lived** `InAppWebView` (no `Key` by `videoId`) without duplicating lifecycle between layers. Splitting a separate “video surface factory” from playback ports would be possible later but is **not** planned unless tests or reuse demand it — the WebView ordering constraints are easy to regress.
- **`supportsSubtitleDisabling`** tells the open coordinator whether `disableRenderedSubtitles()` is meaningful for the active engine. `MediaKitPlayerEngine` returns `true` (it owns the libmpv embedded track list); `YoutubePlayerEngine` returns `false` because there is no libmpv track list to clear — native YouTube CC is instead force-suppressed in the WebView inject script (see [youtube.md](youtube.md) Captions). The open coordinator short-circuits the await on YouTube opens. Callers that need to gate UI on this capability should read it instead of branching on engine type.

## Fullscreen (desktop)

- The transport bar shows a fullscreen toggle button for video on Windows/macOS/Linux. The button is hidden for audio and on non-desktop platforms.
- F11 (customizable) also toggles fullscreen when a video session is active.
- Pressing Escape while fullscreen exits fullscreen first; a second Escape then pops the route/dialog as normal.
- Collapsing the expanded player (via the back arrow or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) also exits fullscreen automatically.

## Future

- Fold echo boundary (segment-end pause-and-rewind) into the deterministic completion loop so mid-file segment boundaries use `await until segment end` instead of tick heuristics (ADR-0044 follow-up).
- Keyboard shortcuts / desktop menu integration.

## Position quantization (single source of truth)

`lib/features/player/application/position_buckets.dart` consolidates the three position quantization buckets into named constants. Do not inline these values in feature code — the per-bucket split keeps the transport scrubber responsive while the transcript highlight avoids per-tick rebuilds that flood the Windows accessibility bridge (flutter/flutter#182444). See `quantized_position.dart` for the dedup behavior.

| Constant | Value | Used by |
|----------|------:|---------|
| `kPositionBucketSessionEmitMs` | 400 | In-memory `PlaybackSession` + debounced DB write cadence — one update per 400 ms bucket so the recorded clip window lines up across runs. Echo *enforcement* itself runs on every position event (see `EchoEnforcer`); only the heavy session emit is gated to this bucket. |
| `kPositionBucketDisplayMs` | 400 | Time display + transcript active-line highlight — 400 ms matches human-perceptible cue changes |
| `kPositionBucketScrubberMs` | 50 | Transport scrubber position updates — finer bucket keeps the slider tracking finger drags without regressing accessibility |

## Open / close behavior

- **`PlayerController.openMedia`** catches exceptions from `engine.open` and any downstream awaits so a failed open does not leave `state` pointing at a phantom session. The player surfaces the error to the existing failure path (`AsyncValue.error`) rather than masking it with stale session metadata.
- **`PlayerController.clear()`** flushes the pending `PlaybackSessionPersister` write **before** cancelling the debounce timer, so a swipe-to-dismiss does not lose the last ~450 ms of position updates. Tests for the persister should cover the "dismiss while debounced write is queued" case explicitly.
