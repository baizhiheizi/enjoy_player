# YouTube playback

## Summary

Users **Import → From YouTube URL** and paste a watch URL, short URL, embed URL, or raw video id. The app stores a `videos` row with `provider: youtube` and `vid` set to the canonical id. A **content language** is collected at import time (YouTube does not expose original language via oEmbed) and can be edited later from Library. Playback uses **`flutter_inappwebview`** loading `https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=<vid>` and controlling the page HTML5 `<video>` (not the iframe embed API — see [ADR-0015](../decisions/0015-youtube-playback.md)).

## Metadata

- **Title / thumbnail**: best-effort [YouTube oEmbed](https://oembed.com/) on import; if it fails, title falls back to `YouTube video <id>`. **Discover → Add to library** passes RSS title/thumbnail when available. When a row still has placeholder title or missing thumbnail, opening the player triggers a **lazy oEmbed retry** after the WebView reports playback-ready (buffering cleared or duration known).
- **Duration**: filled lazily when the WebView reports `loadedmetadata` / duration stream and the row still has `durationSeconds == 0`.

## Login

Optional **YouTube / Google** sign-in opens a **dedicated** WebView (`/youtube/login`) starting at Google ServiceLogin with `continue=https://m.youtube.com/`. Session cookies (`LOGIN_INFO` / `SID`) on `m.youtube.com` determine logged-in state. Logout clears **all** WebView cookies (see ADR-0015). While that route is open, [`RootShell`](../../lib/features/player/presentation/root_shell.dart) **parks** the permanent player surface ([ADR-0057](../decisions/0057-permanent-player-surface-host.md)) so the player WebView cannot cover the login WebView.

**Session persistence**: cookies live in the app WebView profile (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\…\WebView2` on Windows — see [`windows_webview_environment.dart`](../../lib/core/webview/windows_webview_environment.dart)) and normally survive app restarts until logout or Google expires the session. Enjoy account sign-in is separate.

The **player** WebView does **not** complete Google login inline — see [Player navigation](#player-navigation) below.

## Player navigation

While a video is open, the player WebView [`shouldOverrideUrlLoading`](../../lib/features/player/application/engines/youtube/youtube_webview_host.dart) applies [`youtube_watch_navigation_policy.dart`](../../lib/features/player/application/engines/youtube/youtube_watch_navigation_policy.dart) ([ADR-0025](../decisions/0025-youtube-player-block-google-signin-nav.md)):

| Navigation | Policy |
|------------|--------|
| `m.youtube.com` / `youtube.com` / `youtu.be` watch and redirect hops | Allow (main frame only) |
| `googlevideo.com`, `ytimg.com`, and other CDN/static asset hosts | Allow |
| Subresource / iframe loads (`isForMainFrame: false`) | Always allow (all platforms) |
| `consent.youtube.com`, `gstatic.com`, `googleapis.com`, other allowed Google static/consent URLs | Allow |
| **`accounts.google.com` (passive or active sign-in)** | **Cancel** (main frame); player reloads watch URL |
| Unrelated main-frame origins | Cancel |

**Why**: YouTube’s mobile watch page often redirects through **passive Google sign-in** when no session cookies exist. In embedded WebViews (especially **release** builds on any platform), that chain can finish without a playable `<video>` — infinite loading. Blocking account navigations in the player keeps anonymous playback on the watch page; the engine reloads the watch URL when sign-in is cancelled. Use **YouTube login** when a signed-in session is needed.

## Transcripts

Captions are fetched **directly from YouTube** (InnerTube `/player` + `fmt=json3`
timed text) and cached on the worker. The chain has three tiers:

1. **Worker GET cache** (`GET /youtube/transcripts?videoId&language`) — fast
   when another client has already fetched this video. Skipped when the video
   row's content language is missing / `und` / `mul` / `mis` / `zxx` (there is
   no useful single `language` to query with).
2. **Client-side InnerTube fetch** — runs through `YoutubeCaptionFetcher`, which
   rotates through worker-published (or built-in) client profiles and downloads
   **every** available caption track in parallel. This is the runtime form of
   spec 013's FR-001 / FR-002 / FR-004.
3. **Worker upload** — every track downloaded in Tier 2 is fire-and-forget POSTed
   back to the worker so the next client (or this client on another device)
   hits Tier 1 instead. Failed uploads are durably enqueued via `sync_queue`
   (entity `video`, payload `kind: youtube_upload`; deduped per
   `videoId/language` so repeated failures refresh one row) through the shared
   sync enqueue seam — which schedules an **immediate** queue drain when
   signed in (issue #749), with the [SyncCtrl] periodic drain as the
   fallback — and re-uploaded by `SyncEngine`, which dispatches the payload to
   `YoutubeTranscriptsClient.uploadTranscript` (issue #717), with the queue's
   regular [`SyncRetryPolicy`](../../lib/features/sync/domain/sync_retry_policy.dart)
   exponential backoff on continued failure (issue #752). See
   [`transcript_repository.dart`](../../lib/features/transcript/data/transcript_repository.dart).

**Tier 2 always runs for YouTube rows**, even when `videos.language` is empty
or `und`. An unknown language only narrows the Tier 1 lookup and the
`preferredLang` hint passed to the fetcher; the fetcher itself still discovers
all available languages (spec 013 FR-004) and stores them as separate
`TranscriptRow`s keyed by `(target, source, language)`.

### Primary selection

When multiple language tracks are present the post-fetch primary picker ranks
them as:

1. The video's content language (broad subtag match via
   [`matchesLanguageBroad`](../../lib/core/application/app_language_catalog.dart)).
2. The user's **learning** language (broad match). Passed down from
   `AppPreferencesCtrl.effectiveLearningLanguage` through
   `TranscriptFetchCtrl` → `TranscriptRepository.resolveOnOpen` →
   `_fetchYoutubeTranscriptsWithFallback`.
3. Existing source priority (`official` → `auto` → `ai` → `user`, then
   `createdAt`).

A user-picked primary already on the session is **always preserved** —
`_pickYoutubePrimary` short-circuits when `echoSessionDao.transcriptId`
points at a row that still exists. This is the language-aware counterpart
to the source-only `_ensurePrimaryTranscript` used for non-YouTube media.

### Client profiles

The InnerTube rotation uses a `youtubeProfilesProvider` that lazily fetches
the worker's `GET /youtube/client-profiles` on first YouTube open, caches the
result in a 24 h `L1Store`, and **merges** remote entries with the compile-time
`kBuiltInClientProfiles` via `resolveCaptionClientProfiles`. Remote versions
win on the same InnerTube `clientName`; missing clients (today often
`ANDROID_VR` / `MWEB` when the worker only ships `IOS` + `WEB`) are gap-filled
from built-ins. The resolved ladder is always ordered
`ios → android_vr → (android) → mweb → web` (see
[`kPreferredCaptionClientOrder`](../../lib/features/transcript/data/client_profile.dart))
— **not** by Flutter host OS. Within a process, the last profile that
returned fetchable tracks is tried first on subsequent videos (session
sticky via `YoutubeCaptionFetcher._lastSuccessfulCaptionProfileKey`; tests
reset it through `resetLastSuccessfulCaptionProfile()`).

**Cold-start fallback.** When the worker is unreachable, the cached 24 h
profile list is stale-but-cached, or the response envelope is malformed,
the client falls back to `kBuiltInClientProfiles` alone (resolved through
the same `resolveCaptionClientProfiles`). These compile-time defaults ship
with **current 2026 YouTube client versions** (iOS `20.12.1`, Android VR
`1.62.20`, MWEB `2.20251209.01.00`, WEB `2.20250709.00.00`) so the ladder
keeps working even on a fully offline cold start — refresh them in
[`client_profile.dart`](../../lib/features/transcript/data/client_profile.dart)
when YouTube ships a new client version, before bumping the spec
contract.

The timedtext GET for each track uses the **same** profile's user agent and
adds `Referer: https://m.youtube.com/` plus `Accept-Language` so the
`youtubei.googleapis.com` endpoint sees a consistent client identity with the
`/player` call that succeeded.

## Limitations

- **Init speed**: Thumbnail artwork shows during player open and while the WebView buffers. The shared WebView may mount during `openMedia()` (overlapping cold-start with DB work) and is **kept warm** after dismiss until the user opens non-YouTube media or the app exits. Opening local/URL media after a YouTube session **waits for the WebView to detach** (plus a short native-settle pause) before constructing `media_kit`'s `Player`, then tears the old engine down in the background — awaiting dispose on the open path held the skeleton for 5 s (2026-08-30). A wedged first `engine.open` is retried once. `clear()`'s idle-page navigation is also bounded. Optional pre-warm runs when tapping a YouTube row in Library or Discover. After the watch page loads, the engine nudges `<video>.play()` at ~6s if autoplay has not started; **one** full reload may run at ~12s if playback is still stalled (no reload loop once `first_playing`). Playback still uses the mobile watch page — not embed (Error 153 in native WebViews).
- **Play startup (all platforms, Windows especially)**: `flutter_inappwebview`'s `mediaPlaybackRequiresUserGesture` setting is not implemented by its WebView2 backend, so the WebView keeps browser-default autoplay restrictions. Play commands therefore **preserve the element's current audible state** (no forced muted start): Chromium's autoplay engine gives each media element a gesture lock that muted starts bypass, and *unmuting programmatically without fresh user activation pauses the element* ("Unmuting failed and the element was paused instead"). Every earlier forced-muted start was followed by a programmatic unmute in the volume-restore path — tripping exactly that rule ~0.5 s after playback started (the recurring play→pause bug; routing the same cycle through the page player API did not help because `mp.unMute()` ends in the same `video.muted=false`). A `play` event alone never marks the app transport as playing; rejected `play()` promises clear buffering and surface the localized tap-to-play hint. Transport toggle uses an atomic DOM-aware `playOrPause` script so a stale Dart `playing=true` cannot issue another `pause()` while the element is already paused. Explicit user/app play cancels the 6 s nudge and defers stall reloads. **All transport and volume commands prefer the page's own player object** (`#movie_player` / `.html5-video-player` — `playVideo` / `pauseVideo` / `unMute` / `setVolume`) and only fall back to raw `<video>` mutation when that API is missing. **Volume restore runs at most once per watch document**: each fresh document (cold open or post-ad page reload) starts muted, and its first authoritative `playing` event arms a **progress-gated** restore (unmute only after `<video>.currentTime` advances, with a ~1.5 s fallback); later `playing` events in an already-restored document skip volume entirely — redundant `unMute`s are themselves pause triggers. The restore script is idempotent (a no-op request exits without mutation). As a safety net, when an explicit user play **or a volume restore** is confirmed paused almost immediately after starting, the poll loop re-issues play with audible state preserved (transport decisions D8). The retry **escalates with a cap**: if the page re-pauses the retried play as well (the echo-mode field wedge — each attempt outlived the previous one), one further settled retry is granted, up to 2 automatic retries per play command; beyond the cap the pause surfaces as the recovery hint instead of looping. A deliberate pause command anywhere in the chain drops the escalation. The D8 budget (`userPlayInFlight`) spans the whole attempt: it stays armed through the first `playing` — the page player state machine's post-`playing` "correction" back to paused (observed on Android: ~300 ms of playback, then a page-initiated pause with no app command and no volume mutation in the window) is exactly what the retry exists for — it **expires once playback outlives the immediate window** (a 2 s timer from the playing transition, so a budget armed minutes ago can never be spent by a pause after a page-UI resume the app never commanded), and it is consumed by the retry itself, a rejecting/error transition, or any **pause-intent** command (`pause` / `stop` / a transport toggle whose DOM direction was `pause` — the atomic toggle script reports which way it actually went, because session playing state lags DOM pauses by up to ~750 ms), so a deliberate app pause is never auto-resumed. When the D8 retry fires, it also suppresses the post-restore heal for that pause (one play, not two). Irreducible tradeoff: a DOM `pause` carries no initiator, so a pause made through YouTube's own in-page controls within the window of an app-commanded start is retried once (self-limiting — the budget is then spent). Clicking the video pane must reach the WebView — host chrome overlays use `MouseRegion(opaque: false)` / `IgnorePointer` so empty regions do not swallow that gesture.
- **iOS inline playback**: the WebView sets `allowsInlineMediaPlayback`, injects `playsinline` on the `<video>`, and hooks iOS native fullscreen to stay inline so the 16:9 frame stays visible for echo / shadow reading. Player and login WebViews share the same Chrome mobile `userAgent` so Google sign-in is not blocked as an insecure browser.
- Position updates while playing are polled (~250 ms); echo clamp may overshoot slightly vs `media_kit`. The poll runs through the app-owned `YoutubeJsChannel` seam (issue #767) and **shares the transport locator**: it samples the page player's own `<video>`, falling back to a document-level `<video>` when `.html5-video-player` exists but contains none (player rebuild / ad hand-off window) — poll and transport therefore never disagree about which element they drive. The decoded tick is **strict on shape drift**: a missing or mistyped `t`/`s`, or an `s` outside `0/1/2`, drops the tick (never defaults to "playing at t=0"); `d` (duration) is lenient — absent, zero, or mistyped reads as "no finite duration yet".
- Embedded MKV/MP4 subtitle track extraction is unavailable for YouTube (no `media_kit` decode of the stream).
- Ad behavior depends on YouTube, cookies, and account; “no ads” is best-effort when signed in with Premium where applicable.
- **Captions**: YouTube's own captions/CC (`.ytp-caption-window-container` and any native `<track>` cues) are force-hidden by [`kYoutubeMobileWatchInjectScript`](../../lib/features/player/application/engines/youtube/youtube_page_inject.dart) — injected CSS, disabling `video.textTracks`, and unloading the player `captions`/`cc` modules on every hook/enforce cycle. Some videos default captions on (auto-captions, saved viewer prefs), and since the native control bar is also hidden there would otherwise be no way to turn them off; the app's own transcript panel (see [Transcripts](#transcripts) above) is the only caption source shown to users.

## Buffering transitions

`YoutubeSession.emitBuffering(false)` only bumps the internal `mountTick` on the **first** buffering → not-buffering transition per open. Mid-roll ad breaks and re-bufferings after the first play do not retrigger the tick, so the player UI does not flash the loading indicator on every ad pause. Tests for the buffering state should cover the "buffering → playing → buffering → playing" sequence and assert the mountTick only changes once.

## Playback stall detection

[`YoutubePlaybackStallWatchdog`](../../lib/features/player/application/engines/youtube/youtube_playback_stall_watchdog.dart) detects YouTube videos that load but never reach their first frame. After the WebView fires `onLoadStop`, a **12-second** timer starts; if no `playing` event arrives within that window, `onStall(videoId)` fires, logs `youtube playback stalled after load_stop`, and triggers **at most one** full watch-page reload (`recoverStalledPlayback`). Further stalls nudge `play()` only. Explicit user/app play cancels the watchdog and skips the reload path so an in-flight play is not aborted. The timer resets on each new `onLoadStop` (navigating to a new video).

## Platform notes

| Platform | WebView | Profile / cookies | Navigation policy (ADR-0025) | Process crash recovery |
|----------|---------|-------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Windows** | WebView2 via [`platform_webview_environment.dart`](../../lib/core/webview/platform_webview_environment.dart) — user data under `%APPDATA%…\WebView2` (required for Program Files installs) | Shared environment for player + login + Enjoy sign-in | `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` + CDN subframe allowlist | N/A (reload via stall watchdog) |
| **Android** | System WebView | App data directory | `useShouldOverrideUrlLoading: true` | `onRenderProcessGone` → reload watch URL |
| **iOS** | WKWebView | App sandbox | Same policy; `isForMainFrame: null` treated as subframe | `onWebContentProcessDidTerminate` → reload |
| **macOS** | WKWebView | App sandbox | Same as iOS | `onWebContentProcessDidTerminate` → reload |

Login WebViews use the same Windows [`appWebViewEnvironment`](../../lib/core/webview/platform_webview_environment.dart) so YouTube cookies from **YouTube login** apply to the player WebView.

## Troubleshooting (release / cold profile)

If YouTube stalls on loading in a **release** or installed build but works in `flutter run`:

1. Confirm you are on a build that includes the navigation-policy fix (ADR-0025 + subframe/CDN allowlist).
2. Try **YouTube login** once, then reopen the video (establishes session cookies).
3. Check diagnostic logs for `youtube play command` / `youtube playOrPause command`, `youtube video play requested`, `youtube video playing`, `youtube play rejected`, `youtube volume restored`, `youtube post-restore pause heal`, `youtube pause confirmed`, `youtube immediate pause`, `youtube immediate pause retry`, `youtube console [...]` (page-side console messages — Chromium/YouTube autoplay-policy and player warnings), `youtube init load_stop`, `youtube playback stalled`, or `WebView process terminated`. Enable **Settings → About → Diagnostic logging** before reproduction to include the FINE-level command, event, and poll-transition records. Smoking-gun pattern for the unmute variant of the intermittent play→pause bug: `playing` → `youtube volume restored` → `immediate pause` within ~2 s — that sequence means the unmute tripped the WebView's autoplay gesture lock. **Park-resize variant (100% after CC-sheet IPA toggle, Android, 2026-08)**: ADR-0066 used to shrink the parked WebView to 320×180. `m.youtube.com` treats 320 px as a compact-player breakpoint, flushes ABR, and then pauses every programmatic play within ~300–700 ms (`playOrPause` → `playing` → `paused`, retry plays ~0.5 s and pauses again). Focus pinning (`foc=1`) and data-gated retries did not converge because the stimulus was the viewport shrink, not a missing focus signal or an empty buffer. The host now parks YouTube by **translation only** (keeps the live target size). **Buffer-exhaustion variant**: the page player can still pause when playback outruns the buffer — pause `ctx` reads `pstate=3` (buffering). The immediate-pause retry is **data-gated**: it waits (≤ ~5 s, 250 ms steps) until `readyState ≥ 3` AND ≥ 1 s is buffered ahead, then plays; the retry's escalation arm (retry #2 when the retried episode also dies) latches attribution per playing *episode* — poll ticks re-confirming playing must not erase it. A focus-loss trigger was also field-observed (pause `ctx foc=0` while visible; Android may clear the WebView's view focus, which the plugin cannot restore) and is defended by pinning the focus signal in the watch inject + re-asserting on size change and before retries. A physical tap inside the video pane also restores real view focus. The page-correction variant (no `volume restored` in the window): `playOrPause command` → `video playing` → page-initiated `video paused` within ~2 s — the page player state machine correcting a freshly resumed video back to paused. Every `video paused` line carries page context (`ctx=vis=… foc=… muted=… pstate=…`: document visibility, window focus, element mute, page-player state) captured at the moment of the pause — correlate it with `youtube console` lines from the same window to pin the page's reason. A healthy recovery reads `immediate pause` → `immediate pause retry` (play re-issued with audible state preserved) or `volume restored` → `post-restore pause heal`; a persistent failure repeats `immediate pause` without a second retry, which indicates the document genuinely has no user activation and audible start was refused — the tap-to-play hint is then the expected recovery (one physical tap inside the video pane unlocks it).
4. **Windows only**: compare portable `build\windows\x64\runner\Release\enjoy_player.exe` vs Program Files install. Installed builds require a writable WebView2 user-data folder (not next to the exe); diagnostic logs include `webViewUserData=…` and `exe=…` on each session. Shortcuts from the installer set `WorkingDir` to the install folder.

Policy rules are unit-tested in [`youtube_watch_navigation_policy_test.dart`](../../test/features/player/youtube_watch_navigation_policy_test.dart).
