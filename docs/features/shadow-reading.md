# Feature: Shadow reading (echo)

## Summary

Shadow reading is the **record-while-you-listen** flow that lives below the **echo region** in the expanded player. The user listens to a cue, records themselves reading it back via the **shadow reading panel**, optionally runs **Azure pronunciation assessment** on the take, and (now) can **export a shareable practice poster** (see [`echo-mode.md`](echo-mode.md) and [`share-poster.md`](share-poster.md)).

The panel is mounted when **echo mode is active** in the expanded player (with a usable transcript), and also in the vocabulary review **Echo reading** practice overlay (recorder-only, with the context sentence shown above the controls). Global record / play-take / pitch / assess hotkeys pulse `ShadowReadingHotkeyBus` whenever a player session is open **or** vocabulary echo practice is open.

## Recording bus

The recording bus is the single source of truth for "is the user recording right now":

- `ShadowReadingHotkeyBus` (a singleton bus, generated from `shadow_reading_hotkey_bus.dart`) emits typed events (`ShadowRecordingHotkeyEvent`) when the user presses the global shortcut, toggling the panel's idle toolbar state. The bus decouples the hotkey layer (which knows nothing about the panel) from the UI.
- The bus's `isRecordingActive` flag gates Escape dismissal priority. The panel sets it around capture and resets it on stop, cancel, and on panel teardown mid-recording — the teardown reset uses a notifier handle captured while the panel was live and is deferred onto the event loop, because riverpod forbids both provider access from a disposing `ConsumerState` and provider mutation from a widget lifecycle (review on #815). Pinned by `shadow_reading_panel_teardown_test.dart`.
- Mic selection is persisted in `SettingsKeys.prefsRecordingInputDeviceId` and re-read on every take via `recordingInputDeviceCtrlProvider`. Unknown / virtual devices are skipped by `pickPreferredInputDeviceId` (GlideX Shared Audio, VoiceMeeter, VB-Audio CABLE, NVIDIA Broadcast, etc.) so Windows defaults don't silently capture only zeros.

## Take capture & persistence (ShadowTakeStore)

Mic capture and take persistence live in [`ShadowTakeStore`](../../lib/features/shadow_reading/application/shadow_take_store.dart) (issue #597) — the panel is view + callbacks only. Interface: `start(device:)` / `cancel()` / `stopAndPersist(region:)` / `deleteTake(row)` / `dispose()`.

- **Capture**: mic permission gate, `{appSupport}/recordings/{uuid}.wav` paths, and the 16 kHz mono PCM16 WAV config (`buildShadowRecordConfig`, aligned with web + Azure Speech).
- **Recorder lifecycle**: the `MicRecorder` port wraps `package:record`'s `AudioRecorder`; the recorder is **recreated after every `stop()`** — `record` on Windows keeps stale Media Foundation state on the same instance, so reusing it silently produces a zero-sample WAV ("second take won't record").
- **Persistence**: `stopAndPersist` reads the WAV, computes sha256 + duration, applies the **silence heuristic** (RMS < 0.001 or non-zero ratio < 1% → `looksSilent` verdict surfaced by the panel as a warning; the row is persisted regardless), builds the `RecordingRow`, inserts via `recordingDao` (ADR-0002), then enqueues sync create through the injected `SyncEnqueueFn` (ADR-0013).
- **Deletion**: `deleteTake` enqueues sync delete, removes the WAV file, then deletes the DAO row. Stopping preview playback of the take first is the panel's job (a presentation concern).

### Wiring (issue #764)

The panel no longer names a database handle. [`shadow_take_providers.dart`](../../lib/features/shadow_reading/application/shadow_take_providers.dart) owns three seams:

- **`shadowTakeStoreFactoryProvider`** hands back a `ShadowTakeStoreFactory` already bound to `appDatabaseProvider` and `syncEnqueueProvider`. It is a **factory, not a store provider**: a store owns a `MicRecorder` (recreated after every stop) and an `_active` flag, and the panel is embedded more than once — transcript echo cards are list items — so several panels can be mounted at once. One shared store would let one panel's capture mark another as recording and would hand two panels the same recorder. The panel keeps ownership (and disposes the recorder in its own `dispose`); only the wiring moved.
- **`echoRegionRecordingsProvider`** — the take list for one echo window.
- **`echoRegionRecordingsOnceProvider`** — the same window as a one-shot read, for the playback / assessment hotkey handlers, which act on a single take and must not open a subscription per keypress.

The panel's `RecordingRow` mentions are type-only (`app_database.dart` supplies the Drift row shape); it holds no database handle and issues no queries. These providers are hand-written rather than `@riverpod`-annotated because `riverpod_generator` raises `InvalidTypeException` on Drift row types and on function-typed returns (same workaround as `syncEnqueueProvider`).

Craft's `CaptureStage` still owns its own capture loop (it needs the amplitude stream and does not persist takes); migrating it onto the shared `MicRecorder` port is a follow-up.

## Idle toolbar (centered FAB)

- The panel shows an **idle toolbar** with the **pitch icon**, a centered **FAB** (start recording), **play**, and **pronunciation assess**. Delete moves into a **more** menu gated by a confirmation dialog.
- When recording is in flight, the panel swaps to **recording-only focus**: FAB + countdown vs the active echo segment, with the pitch chart and takes list hidden until the take is committed. The countdown ring has a **single timing source** (review on #815): one `Ticker` sets the elapsed seconds on an `AnimationController` that exists purely as the painter's `repaint` listenable inside a `RepaintBoundary` (issue #810 E2), so each vsync **repaints the ring without rebuilding any element**, and the same tick re-evaluates the over-target pulse phase. The elapsed caption text re-renders on a ~10 Hz timer (`ShadowRecordingLive`), matching its seconds-resolution display. Over-target state (error ring + pulse) still rebuilds discretely on the flip and at the 600 ms pulse cadence.
- All idle toolbar controls use **≥44×44** hit targets where possible; the assessment badge control is **44×44** with explicit `Semantics(label, button)` so VoiceOver / TalkBack see it as a control, not only a tooltip.

## Pitch contour

When the user opts in, the panel runs **pitch contour** analysis on the take:

1. `echo_segment_pcm_extractor.dart` extracts the relevant echo segment to a temp `.raw` via **FFmpeg** (CLI on Windows, FFmpegKit elsewhere). Extraction is **cancellable** (`EchoPcmCancelToken` kills the live FFmpeg process/session) and **bounded** by a per-call timeout; failures surface a typed `EchoPcmExtractionException` (e.g. `ffmpegMissing`) instead of a silent `null`. FFmpeg binary resolution goes through the single shared `FfmpegMediaProbe.resolveFfmpegExecutable()` (memoized for the process lifetime).
2. The byte→Float32 **decode + YIN** (`yin_pitch.dart`) both run inside **one worker isolate** (`Isolate.run`), so the multi-megabyte PCM buffer never blocks the UI thread and never crosses an isolate port — only the ~520-point analysis result is returned.
3. `echo_pitch_analysis_service.dart` caches results per region/recording (so re-opening a region reuses the analysis) and **cancels** — not merely discards — an in-flight extraction when the region/recording changes. Exposed as the keep-alive `echoPitchAnalysisServiceProvider`.
4. `pitch_contour_chart.dart` renders the envelope; `pitch_contour_section.dart` exposes it as a collapsible section that can be **parent-driven** (`expanded`, `showHeader: false` for chart-only body). The merged reference+user series is **memoized** (`EchoMergedSeriesMemo`) so it is built once per (reference, user) pair — identical across playback ticks — and `shouldRepaint` compares the points by content so the painter skips work when only the progress cursor moves. The live position cursor feeds the chart through a leaf `Consumer` inside the panel that watches `displayPositionProvider` **only while the contour is expanded** (issue #810 E1), so the collapsed panel never subscribes and position ticks never rebuild the panel itself — only the contour subtree.

## Pronunciation assessment (Azure)

The optional **pronunciation assessment** path runs after a take lands:

1. `recording_assessment_controller.dart` requests a **Worker Azure speech token** from Enjoy (`POST /ai/pronunciation/token`) and passes it to the native `azure_speech` plugin. The Azure locale is resolved from the **media/recording language** via [`resolveAzureAssessmentLocaleForPractice`](../../lib/core/application/app_language_catalog.dart). Supported regional tags (e.g. `en-US`, `en-GB`, `es-ES`, `fr-CA`, `nb-NO`) are preserved. Unknown media tags (`und` / empty — typical for YouTube imports without a set content language) fall back to the learner's **focus language** (then `en-US` default). Real unsupported primaries still **disable** assessment with an explanatory tooltip — the app does **not** silently coerce those to `en-US`.
2. The plugin returns a JSON `pronunciationScore` / `accuracyScore` / `fluencyScore` / `completenessScore` plus per-word detail. The result is persisted to the recording row (`pronunciation_score`, `assessment_json`).
3. `AssessmentResultDialog` / sheet reopens the score when the user taps the score badge. The wide layout uses the **rail breakpoint** (900px), not the transcript breakpoint (720px).
4. Take menu shows per-take scores and a **Re-assess** entry when the current take already has `assessment_json`.
5. **Model pronounce on results** — The selected-word panel offers a shared **Pronounce** control ([ADR-0064](../decisions/0064-word-pronounce-client.md)) for the chosen chip word. It plays Worker model audio (standard pronunciation). Locale uses the same `resolveAzureAssessmentLocaleForPractice` path as the assessment run (`und`/empty media → learning language), not the raw recording tag.
6. **Take replay + karaoke + word clips** — The result surface receives `recordingPath` (`RecordingRow.localPath`). A **Play my recording** control near the overall score replays the full take via the ADR-0003 `RecordingPreviewPlayer` (not `PlayerController`). While the full take plays, word chips get a karaoke-style “current” highlight from Azure per-word `Offset`/`Duration` ticks (converted to ms). Selecting a chip stops full-take playback. The selected-word panel also offers **Play my recording of this word** (timed clip via `playClip`); omissions / zero-duration words disable the clip. Model pronounce, full take, and word clip are mutually exclusive (starting one stops the others). Dismissing the dialog/sheet stops take/clip and model pronounce.

Silent FFmpeg WAV normalize is auto-detected and the resample chain is retried (see commit history around Azure assessment). Zero-score runs are persisted and logged.

**Credits rejection (spec 045)**: when the token request is rejected because Enjoy credits are exhausted (worker 402), the controller returns the dedicated `credits` failure kind carrying the envelope, and the flow shows the shared friendly message — required vs. remaining credits and reset time when provided — with the **View plans & packages** snackbar action. The recording is kept and re-assessment works after purchase; the raw status string never reaches the user.
