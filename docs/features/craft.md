# Craft from Text

## Summary

**Craft** helps language learners build a personal library of shadow-reading audio by turning spoken or typed thoughts into idiomatic target-language audio. Generated items are regular library media (`provider = 'craft'`) — they support echo mode, transcripts, library browsing, and cloud sync without special wiring.

Craft ships two modes (see [ADR-0060](../decisions/0060-craft-voice-express-dual-mode.md)):

| Mode | Entry | What it does | When to use |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Express** (default) | Speak a thought | Voice-first linear flow: speak → ASR → AI rewrite → TTS → save/loop | You want to capture spontaneous thoughts fast |
| **Advanced** | Paste / type text | Two-tool layout: Translate panel + Synthesize panel | You already have prepared text |

The mode is selected with a `SegmentedButton<CraftScreenMode>` in the app bar (`craftModeExpress` / `craftModeAdvanced` labels).

## Navigation

Craft is a first-class entry point (see [ADR-0061](../decisions/0061-craft-first-class-history.md)), reachable from three places:

- **Home header** — an `OutlinedButton.icon` labelled `homeCraftAction` sits before the `Import` button in both `EditorialHeader` trailing sites on Home (loaded and loading/skeleton states share a `_HomeHeaderActions` widget) → `/craft`.
- **Global hotkey** — `c` (`global.craft` in `hotkey_definitions.dart`, scope `global`, customizable) opens Craft from anywhere in the app. No-op when already on `/craft` or a `/craft/*` route.
- **Import chooser** → **Craft from text…** → `/craft` (original entry point, retained).

Flows as a full-screen route; back returns to wherever the user came from.

**Branding**: "Craft" is kept as an untranslated brand term in the Chinese locale (`craftScreenTitle` / `homeCraftAction` both render `"Craft"` in `app_zh.arb`), matching the existing `importCraftFromText` → `"Craft…"` convention — it is not translated to a Chinese word.

### Remembered preferences

Craft choices persist across sessions so learners don't re-pick them every time. `CraftPreferencesCtrl` (keepAlive, per-user) stores a JSON blob under the Drift settings key `craft.preferences_v1` (`SettingsKeys.craftPreferencesV1`):

| Persisted | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Last screen mode | Express / Advanced — reopening Craft restores it |
| Translation style **per mode** | `expressStyle` (first-run default `auto`) and `advancedStyle` (first-run default `natural`) |
| Custom prompt | Remembered alongside the style it belongs to |
| Voice **per base language** | Map like `{'en': 'en-US-GuyNeural'}`; entries validate against `kAzureVoices` on load and are dropped if the catalog changed |

Deliberately **not** persisted: the language pair. It always re-seeds from the learner's profile settings on entry — `CraftController.build()` reads `AppPreferencesCtrl.effectiveNativeLanguage` / `effectiveLearningLanguage` synchronously (so the Express idle pill never renders the `—` placeholder), and the lazy per-widget seeding that used to live in `CaptureStage._startRecording` / `TranslateTool.initState` is gone.

Sign-in semantics mirror `AppPreferencesCtrl`: the blob lives in the per-user DB, so reads/writes are skipped while signed out (translate still works; choices are session-only). `CraftController` setters write through to the prefs controller but never persist on programmatic restores — `loadForEdit` prefills an item's own values via `copyWith` and does not touch the blob. A late hydration never clobbers user input: every user-intent setter latches `_prefsHydrationMutated`, and hydration is skipped while an edit-from-history restore is in flight.

### Craft history (`/craft/history`)

An in-app-bar history `IconButton` (tooltip `craftHistoryTooltip`) on the Craft screen opens `CraftHistoryScreen`, which lists every media item where `Audios.provider == 'craft'`, newest-updated first (`craftHistoryProvider` — a thin `StreamProvider` over `mediaRegistryProvider.watchAll()`, no new query or schema). Empty state uses `craftHistoryEmptyTitle` / `craftHistoryEmptyHint` / `craftHistoryEmptyAction`.

Each row can **Remove Craft record** (`CraftLibraryRepository.removeCraftHistoryRecord`): clears Craft provenance by setting `Audios.provider` from `'craft'` to `'user'`. The same media id, audio file, and transcript stay in the library for practice (no Craft badge). This is not a library delete and not a soft-hide list. If the removed item is the active edit session (`editingMediaId`), the controller resets via `resetForNextCapture`.

### Edit an existing Craft item

Tapping a history item calls `CraftController.loadForEdit(mediaId)`:

- Loads a `CraftEditSource` snapshot (`lib/features/craft/domain/craft_edit_source.dart`) via `CraftLibraryRepository.getCraftEditSource` — returns `null` (surfaced as `craftEditUnavailable`) if the item no longer exists.
- Prefills **Express** mode (stage `rewrite`) when the item's `sourceFlag == 'craft-express'` and it has a native-language transcript; otherwise prefills **Advanced** mode with the reconstructed practice text loaded into the Synthesize tool.
- Sets `CraftJobState.editingMediaId`, which routes the next `saveToLibrary` call to `CraftLibraryRepository.updateCraftedFromText` (update the same media id, replacing audio + primary transcript) instead of `CraftLibraryRepository.importCraftedFromText` — editing never creates a duplicate library entry. `editingMediaId` is cleared by `setScreenMode` and `resetForNextCapture`.

## Express mode

A linear three-stage pipeline (`CraftStage` enum: `capture` → `rewrite` → `audio`) orchestrated by `ExpressFlow`. The core product insight: **learners can't speak fluently because they don't have enough to say** — so the default flow starts from the user's own voice, not prepared text.

### Capture stage (`CaptureStage`)

- Large mic button (72px phone / 88px tablet+); tap to start, tap red stop button to finish
- Live waveform animation + recording timer while recording
- **Cancel** — discards the take without ASR (`CraftController.cancelCapture()`); also wired to Escape (cancel in place, same priority as shadow-reading cancel) and route leave / back (clears `isCapturing` so reopen cannot stick on a dead Stop UI)
- **Text fallback** — "type instead" link replaces the mic with a `TextField` (skips ASR)
- `AudioRecorder` is owned by the widget (not the controller), recreated after each stop — mirrors the `ShadowReadingPanel` pattern (16kHz mono WAV)
- On stop, `CraftController.stopCapture(bytes)` stores the bytes and `transcribeAndRewrite()` runs ASR (`CraftTranscriber`) → guarded empty-transcript check → LLM rewrite (`CraftTranslator`) → advances to the rewrite stage

### Rewrite stage (`RewriteStage`)

- **Editable native transcript card** (labelled "Your words") — STT / typed source is a `TextField` so learners can correct recognition errors; edits write to `rawTranscript` (+ synced `sourceText`). When the native text differs from the last successful rewrite input (`isRawTranscriptDirty`), a **Re-translate** action appears on the card (`craftReTranslateButton`)
- **Editable target text card** (labelled "In [target]…") — `TextEditingController` synced to `state.translatedText` only when the field is not focused, so user edits are preserved across regenerations; field is height-capped (`maxLines: 10`) to avoid layout overflow
- **Options panel** — always-visible `StylePicker` + Azure Neural `VoicePicker` before Generate; style starts from the remembered Express style (**Auto** on first run); voice from the remembered per-language pick, falling back via `defaultVoiceForLanguage` when unset
- Re-translate / Regenerate keep the form visible with inline progress when a target already exists (full-screen "Crafting…" spinner only for the first rewrite)
- Three action buttons:
  - **Regenerate** → `controller.regenerate()` — re-runs the LLM rewrite on the current native transcript with the current style (same path as Re-translate; no-op if below `craftMinTextLength`)
  - **Re-record** → `controller.resetForNextCapture()` — back to the capture stage
  - **Generate audio** → `controller.generateAudio()` — synthesizes with `selectedVoice` and advances to the audio stage

### "Auto" translation style

A new `TranslationStyle.auto` is the **default** for Express mode. Instead of a literal translation, the system prompt (defined in `CraftTranslationServiceTranslator._autoStylePrompt()`) instructs the LLM to act as a **language partner** — reading the user's spontaneous thought, understanding their intent and personal style, and rewriting it idiomatically in the target language as a fluent speaker would naturally say it. The prompt is distinct from all other style prompts (literal, natural, casual, etc.).

`auto.promptSuffix` returns an empty string (the full prompt is assembled by the translator) and `showsCustomPrompt` returns false (no custom-prompt field is shown when Auto is selected).

### Audio stage (`AudioStage`)

- **Script block** — language pair + full learning-language text (selectable) with a left-border accent, so the learner can follow along while previewing. Long scripts scroll inside a capped viewport (~240px) so the player and actions stay reachable; text is never ellipsis-truncated.
- **Inline preview player** — play/pause circle with a single-row progress control (time · slider · duration), driven by `audioplayers` `AudioPlayer` reading `state.previewAudioBytes` from memory via `BytesSource`
- **Voice** control (shows current voice label; expandable to full `VoicePicker` — changing voice re-synthesizes)
- **Unsaved hint** — when `hasUnsavedPreview` is true, an inline callout (`craftAudioUnsavedHint`) reminds the learner that TTS bytes are in memory only until a save CTA runs
- Two save CTAs (labels make persistence explicit):
  - **Save & practice** (`saveAndPractice`) — primary `EnjoyButton`; saves and navigates to the player route with the new media ID
  - **Save & say another** (`saveAndCaptureNext`) — outlined secondary; saves to library, shows a snackbar confirmation ("Saved to library"), then resets to the capture stage while preserving the language pair, style, and voice (remembered across sessions — see [Remembered preferences](#remembered-preferences)). This is the **rapid-capture loop** for building a personal library in quick succession.
- **Leave / mode-switch guard** — `CraftScreen` blocks system back and the mode segmented control while `hasUnsavedPreview` (or while capturing). Confirming discard (`confirmDiscardUnsavedCraftPreview`) drops the in-memory preview; cancel keeps the learner on the audio stage. Preview is never written to SQLite until `saveToLibrary` succeeds.

### Failure handling in Express stages

Every Express stage watches `state.failure` and renders a calm error card using the failure's localized `message(l10n)` with a concrete action button mapped from `failure.action`. New failure types for the voice flow:

| Failure | Trigger | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `CraftAsrFailure` | ASR service error (offline, vendor down) | Retry |
| `CraftEmptyTranscriptFailure` | ASR returned a transcript shorter than `craftMinTextLength` | Retry |

Existing failures (`CraftTranslateFailure`, `CraftTtsFailure`, `CraftSaveFailure`, etc.) surface in the same way.

## Advanced mode

Retained for users who already have prepared text. Uses `EnjoyPageKind.hub` (same width family as AI settings) with **stacked** `EnjoyCard` panels — Translate above Synthesize — instead of a cramped dual column.

### Translate tool (`TranslateTool`)

- **Source language** picker (from the lookup language catalog)
- **Target language** pre-filled from the learner's focus language
- **Style preset** selector (formal, casual, etc.) with an optional custom prompt
- **Edit / copy / re-translate** actions on the translated output
- **Same-language guard**: selecting the same source and target language surfaces a localized hint to switch to Speak directly

### Synthesize tool (`SynthesizeTool`)

- **Text** input (either the translated result or pasted learning-language text)
- **Target language** (pre-filled)
- **Voice picker** (Azure Neural voices per language)
- **Preview** button to hear a sample before saving
- **Save** generates the audio file and inserts the media row

### Voice picker (v1)

Azure Neural voices grouped by language. Supported languages map to the subset of the lookup catalog that Enjoy TTS supports:

| Code | Language | Voices |
|------|----------|--------|
| en-US | English (US) | 15+ neural voices |
| zh-CN | Chinese (Mandarin) | 8+ neural voices |
| ja-JP | Japanese | 5+ neural voices |
| ko-KR | Korean | 3+ neural voices |
| es-ES / es-MX | Spanish | 6+ neural voices |
| fr-FR / fr-CA | French | 6+ neural voices |
| de-DE | German | 5+ neural voices |
| pt-BR / pt-PT | Portuguese | 3+ neural voices |
| it-IT | Italian | 3+ neural voices |
| ru-RU | Russian | 2+ neural voices |

Per-call voice selection is v1 scope; the provider-default voice is used for initial creation. Voice names and gender labels come from `AzureVoice` (`lib/features/craft/domain/azure_voice.dart`).

## Provider / capability routing

| Action | Enjoy (default) | BYOK |
|--------|----------------|------|
| Translate | `chatServiceProvider` → Enjoy worker `POST /translations` | `chatServiceProvider` → BYOK LLM (OpenAI / Anthropic / Google-compatible) |
| Synthesize | `ttsServiceProvider` → `EnjoyTtsCapability` → Azure Speech SDK (worker token) | `ttsServiceProvider` → BYOK TTS (OpenAI `/audio/speech` or Azure Speech subscription key) |

**Azure Speech SDK wiring** (`lib/features/craft/data/craft_tts_service_synthesizer.dart`):
1. Fetch a short-lived Azure token via `AzureTokenCache.getToken(purpose: 'tts', textLength: text.length)` (worker endpoint `POST /azure/tokens`, 9-min TTL). The TTS body sends `usage.tts.textLength` (character count) — not a duration estimate — to match the worker `azureTokenBodySchema` Zod validator and the web `@enjoy/ai` contract.
2. Call `AzureSpeech.instance.synthesize(text, voice, locale)` through the native plugin ([`packages/azure_speech`](../../packages/azure_speech/)).
3. The native SDK returns a WAV byte buffer; saved to the app's audio directory.

BYOK TTS follows the same `AzureSpeech.instance.synthesize` path when BYOK is configured with an Azure subscription key, or calls `TtsService` via the OpenAI-compatible HTTP path.

## Word-segmented transcript

After synthesis, `wordBoundary` events from the Azure Speech SDK produce time-aligned `startMs` / `durationMs` segments. The word segmenter (`lib/features/craft/domain/word_boundary_segmenter.dart`) groups words into **shadow-friendly lines** sized for shadow-reading practice (target 1.5–6 s spoken duration, hard cap 7 s). Break points follow a priority order: sentence-ending punctuation → clause punctuation (commas, semicolons, colons, em-dashes, CJK `、，；：`) → largest inter-word silence gap → duration cap. CJK text (zh/ja/ko, detected via the synth language) breaks by punctuation + duration only, never by word count, and joins segment text spacelessly.

**All platforms with word boundaries**: Android, Windows, iOS, and macOS all capture Azure `WordBoundary` events and feed them through the same shadow-friendly segmenter. The iOS/macOS native plugin (`packages/azure_speech/`) registers `addSynthesisWordBoundaryEventHandler` before synthesis; note that the Azure Speech ObjC binding reports `duration` in seconds (converted to ticks at the native layer) and the `boundaryType` enum has a `Word`/`Punctuation` collision, so punctuation tokens are classified by text on the Dart side.

**Solid timings only (ADR-0063)**: Craft writes a primary AI transcript (`source: 'ai'`) only when word boundaries are non-empty **and** the segmenter produces ≥1 non-empty line after punctuation merge. When word boundaries are missing (OpenAI BYOK TTS, or Linux which has no native TTS plugin), no transcript is saved — `primaryTimelineJson: null` is passed on import/update, which omits or deletes transcript rows. The audio file still saves successfully.

**Always-on nested word/phone spans (ADR-0073 / ADR-0076)**: every real (non-dedupe) Craft save attempts on-device `alignSegments` and may attach nested `timeline` / `phones` onto those same spec 030 lines. Blank 030 JSON, a dedupe hit, PCM extract failure, or alignment failure persist today’s line-only (or blank) transcript — never a blocking save error, never an invented cue list. Learners still hear the Azure/Craft WAV; the spoken alignment reference is not played. Karaoke / IPA display are opt-in player transcript controls (ADR-0076).

- Items with a blank transcript open in the player with an empty transcript panel and a clear **Generate** affordance, allowing the learner to create cues via the existing player ASR flow (`launchAsrGeneration`) at any time.
- No auto-STT runs on Craft save — the learner initiates ASR explicitly.
- The `TranscriptTimestampEstimator` (duration-based proportional estimate) is no longer used on Craft save; the segmenter exclusively consumes live Azure word boundaries.

## Output schema

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `Audios.provider` | `'craft'` |
| `Audios.source` | `'craft-express'` (Express mode), `'craft-translate'` (Advanced translate mode), or `'craft-direct'` (Advanced speak directly) |
| `Audios.sourceText` | Original text (retained for re-generation). In Express mode this is the raw ASR transcript; in Advanced translate mode it is the source text; in speak directly it is empty. |
| Audio file | WAV in app audio directory |
| Transcript | One track (`source = 'ai'`) with word-boundary-segmented lines when solid timings are available; omitted (`null`) otherwise (see ADR-0063). When alignment succeeds on save, those lines may also store nested word/phone spans (ADR-0073 / ADR-0076). Secondary source-text track in translate mode. Blank-transcript items show an ASR Generate affordance in the player. |

### Deduplication

`SHA-256(sourceFlag | learningLanguage | normalizedText)`. Re-pasting identical text returns the existing media id without making any AI calls. `normalizedText` strips whitespace differences and normalizes Unicode so copy-paste variation does not defeat dedup. Express items use `sourceFlag = 'craft-express'`, so they dedupe independently from Advanced-mode items with the same text.

## Library surface

- **Craft badge**: Library tiles show a Craft indicator for items where `Audios.provider == 'craft'`.
- **Sync routing**: `provider = 'craft'` participates in the existing sync queue (metadata + recording uploads).
- **`deleteMedia` cleanup**: Deleting a Craft media item removes the audio file, transcript rows, and sync queue entry.
- **Blank transcript**: Items where TTS synthesis did not produce reliable word boundaries open with an empty transcript panel and an ASR **Generate** affordance (ADR-0063). Learners can generate cues later via the player ASR flow.

## Cross-platform sync (Crafted Audio Cloud Sync, ADR-0081)

Crafted audios are uploaded to cloud storage so the same audio is playable from any device the user signs in on. Imported user files (`provider = 'user'`) and YouTube downloads (`provider = 'youtube'`) are explicitly out of scope — only the small crafted audios are uploaded automatically.

- **Trigger**: `CraftAudioCloudUploader.uploadIfNeeded()` runs as a pre-step inside `SyncUploadService.uploadAudio()`, gated on `row.provider == 'craft'`. The binary is uploaded via the existing `DirectUploadsApi.uploadBlob` (Rails Active Storage direct upload), and the returned `signedId` is included in the JSON payload of `POST /api/v1/mine/audios`. The server attaches the blob and returns a populated `mediaUrl`.
- **Offline tolerance**: the binary upload is part of the existing sync queue. Crafting while offline saves locally and queues the upload for the next sync drain. The library badge shows **Pending sync** until it succeeds.
- **Idempotency**: the uploader skips a row when `mediaUrl` is already populated. `CraftLibraryRepository.updateCraftedFromText` resets `mediaUrl` to `null` on every edit so re-crafting always re-uploads the new bytes.
- **UI badge**: `MediaCardSyncBadgePill` renders on the thumbnail top-right of `MediaCardRow` / `MediaCardTile` for crafted audios. Three states:
  - **Synced to cloud** (green cloud-check) — `mediaUrl != null`.
  - **Pending sync** (muted cloud-upload) — `mediaUrl == null && syncStatus == 'pending'`.
  - **Local only** (muted cloud-off) — everything else.
- **Delete**: `DELETE /api/v1/mine/audios/:id` is the single delete call. The server cascades to the underlying blob via `dependent: :destroy` (verified against the web app, which uses the same pattern).
- **Scope guard**: `provider = 'user'` and `provider = 'youtube'` rows DO NOT trigger the uploader — verified by `test/features/sync/sync_upload_service_crafted_branch_test.dart`. Imported 50 MB+ files are not silently uploaded.

See `specs/043-craft-cloud-sync/` for the full spec, plan, contracts, and quickstart validation scenarios.

## Failure handling

All failures go through the `CraftFailure` sealed hierarchy (`lib/features/craft/domain/craft_failure.dart`):

| Failure | Trigger | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `CraftTranslateFailure` | Translation API error | Retry |
| `CraftTtsFailure` | TTS synthesis error | Retry or open AI settings |
| `CraftSaveFailure` | File write or DB insert error | Retry |
| `CraftSignInRequiredFailure` | Auth session missing | Sign in |
| `CraftOfflineFailure` | No network | Retry when online |
| `CraftSameLanguageFailure` | Source and target language match | Switch to Speak directly |
| `CraftVendorUnsupportedLanguageFailure` | Vendor doesn't support the language | Retry (change language) |
| `CraftAsrFailure` | ASR service error (Express mode only) | Retry |
| `CraftEmptyTranscriptFailure` | ASR transcript shorter than `craftMinTextLength` (Express mode only) | Retry |
| `CraftCreditsFailure` | Enjoy credits exhausted (worker 402) on any stage — carries the envelope so the message shows required vs. remaining credits | Retry + **View plans & packages** → `/subscription` (spec 045) |

**All-or-nothing write**: Translation, synthesis, and save run in a single try block. If any stage fails, no repository write happens — no orphan transcript rows or audio files.

## v1 limits and out-of-scope

| Constraint | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Text length | 5 000 characters (truncated with ellipsis) |
| Voice picker | Azure Neural only; no local/offline TTS |
| Output format | Audio-only (no video generation) |
| Per-call voice | Provider-default voice used; picker is v1 |
| Offline | Requires network (Enjoy worker or BYOK endpoint) |
| Transcript (Linux / BYOK OpenAI) | Linux has no Azure Speech native plugin and OpenAI BYOK TTS does not produce Azure word boundaries — Craft items from those paths open without a timed transcript. Use the player ASR flow to generate cues. |

## Responsive layout

The Craft screen adapts to phone, tablet, and desktop widths (see [ADR-0055](../decisions/0055-adaptive-page-layout-system.md)):

- **Express mode** uses `EnjoyPageKind.form` — a centered single column with adaptive gutters (no per-screen max widths)
- **Advanced mode** uses `pageGutterOf` for full-bleed gutters
- **AdvancedTools** uses a `LayoutBuilder` with a 600px breakpoint: side-by-side `Row` (TranslateTool left, SynthesizeTool right) on wide screens, stacked `Column` on narrow screens

No `isWide` width calculations or ad-hoc max widths live in Craft widgets — all spacing flows from the layout-token system.
