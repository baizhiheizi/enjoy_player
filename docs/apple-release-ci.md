# Apple release CI setup

Guide for configuring [`.github/workflows/release_apple.yml`](../.github/workflows/release_apple.yml) on GitHub.

The workflow runs on your **self-hosted macOS runner** (`runs-on: [self-hosted, macos]`) — the same machine you use for local Xcode builds. Smoke builds stay in [`build_apple.yml`](../.github/workflows/build_apple.yml).

## What the release workflow does

1. `flutter analyze` + `flutter test`
2. Builds signed **iOS IPA** (`flutter build ipa`)
3. Optionally uploads to **TestFlight**
4. Builds **macOS release** `.app`
5. Optionally **notarizes** macOS for direct download
6. Optionally **publishes** macOS zip to dl.enjoy.bot — no GitHub artifact upload (avoids storage billing). IPA goes to TestFlight when enabled.

**Triggers**

- **Manual only**: GitHub → Actions → **Release Apple** → **Run workflow**. There is no tag-push trigger — releases are always started explicitly.

## Step 1 — Apple Developer / App Store Connect (one-time)

### 1a. App Store Connect app record

1. Open [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) → **Apps** → **+** → New App.
2. Bundle ID: **`ai.enjoy.player`**
3. If the bundle ID is missing, create it first in [Developer → Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list).

Without this record, IPA export/upload fails with *Error Downloading App Information*.

### 1b. App Store Connect API key (required for CI upload + notarization)

1. [App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api)
2. Click **+** to generate a key.
3. Name: e.g. `Enjoy Player CI`
4. Access: **App Manager** (or **Admin**)
5. Download the **`.p8`** file — **you can only download it once**.
6. Note:
   - **Issuer ID** (top of the API page, UUID)
   - **Key ID** (10 characters, e.g. `AB12CD34EF`)
   - **Team ID**: `46X685R747`

Add these three values as GitHub **Secrets** (see table below).

---

## Step 2 — Signing certificates

You need two certificates in [Developer → Certificates](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list):

| Certificate | Used for |
|-------------|----------|
| **Apple Distribution** | iOS App Store / TestFlight |
| **Developer ID Application** | macOS direct download |

### Option A — Self-hosted Mac already has certs (recommended for you)

If your Mac runner already has both certs in Keychain (from local Xcode work), **you do not need to export `.p12` files**.

Set a GitHub **Repository variable**:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `APPLE_USE_RUNNER_KEYCHAIN` | `true` |

The workflow will use the login keychain on the runner.

Verify on the Mac:

```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

You should see:

- `Apple Distribution: … (46X685R747)`
- `Developer ID Application: … (46X685R747)`

Also ensure Xcode is signed in with the Enjoy team and **Automatically manage signing** is enabled for `ai.enjoy.player`.

### Option B — Import certs from GitHub Secrets (portable runners)

Export each certificate from Keychain Access:

1. Open **Keychain Access** → **My Certificates**.
2. Expand **Apple Distribution: …** → select **both** the cert and private key → Export → `.p12`.
3. Repeat for **Developer ID Application: …**.
4. Choose an export password (remember it for GitHub Secrets).

Base64-encode for GitHub (run on Mac):

```bash
base64 -i AppleDistribution.p12 | pbcopy    # paste into secret
base64 -i DeveloperIDApplication.p12 | pbcopy
```

Set repository variable `APPLE_USE_RUNNER_KEYCHAIN` to `false` (or delete it).

---

## Step 3 — GitHub Secrets & variables

Open the repo on GitHub → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**.

### Required secrets (minimum for TestFlight + notarization)

| Secret name | Where to get it | Example / notes |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID` | App Store Connect API page | `AB12CD34EF` |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID` | App Store Connect API page (Issuer ID) | `69a6de8e-…` UUID |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_PRIVATE_KEY` | Entire contents of downloaded `AuthKey_XXXX.p8` | Paste full file including `BEGIN/END PRIVATE KEY` lines |

### Optional secrets (only if `APPLE_USE_RUNNER_KEYCHAIN` is not `true`)

| Secret name | Where to get it |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` | Any strong random string (temp CI keychain only) |
| `IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERT_BASE64` | Base64 of Apple Distribution `.p12` |
| `IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERT_PASSWORD` | Password you set when exporting `.p12` |
| `MACOS_DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_BASE64` | Base64 of Developer ID Application `.p12` |
| `MACOS_DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_PASSWORD` | Password you set when exporting `.p12` |

### Repository variables

| Variable | Recommended value |
|----------|-------------------|
| `APPLE_USE_RUNNER_KEYCHAIN` | `true` on your self-hosted Mac |

## Step 4 — Self-hosted runner checklist

All workflows use repo self-hosted runners. Setup, labels, and per-OS toolchains are documented in [ci-self-hosted-runners.md](ci-self-hosted-runners.md).

On the Mac that runs GitHub Actions:

```bash
# Labels must include: self-hosted, macos
# Register via: GitHub repo → Settings → Actions → Runners

flutter doctor
xcodebuild -version
pod --version
ruby --version   # 3.2+ for fastlane (TestFlight upload via pilot); brew install ruby
bundle --version
brew bundle install --file=macos/Brewfile
```

Runner user must be able to run `codesign`, `xcrun notarytool`, and access Keychain certs. The TestFlight upload itself runs via fastlane `pilot` ([`fastlane/Fastfile`](../fastlane/Fastfile)); `ensure_fastlane_tooling.sh` installs the `Gemfile.lock`-pinned gems into a repo-local path on first use.

**Local Apple secrets** (same Mac as the self-hosted runner) live in one directory:

```
~/.config/enjoy-player/
  asc.env                 # KEY_ID + ISSUER_ID (written by CI helpers when secrets are present)
  AuthKey_<KEY_ID>.p8     # private key (cached from APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_PRIVATE_KEY)
```

Signing identities stay in the login Keychain. IPA / zip outputs under `build/` are ephemeral. Preflight:

```bash
bash .github/scripts/verify_macos_release_env.sh
```

---

## Step 5 — Run a release

1. Bump version in `pubspec.yaml` if needed.
2. GitHub → **Actions** → **Release Apple** → **Run workflow**.
3. Toggle **Upload TestFlight** / **Notarize macOS** / **Publish** as needed.
4. Collect outputs from the runner workspace, or check dl.enjoy.bot when **Publish** was enabled:
   - `build/ios/ipa/EnjoyPlayer-vX.Y.Z.ipa`
   - `EnjoyPlayer-macOS-vX.Y.Z.zip` (repo root after rename step)

When **Publish** is enabled, a **Publish macOS direct-download feeds** step uploads `EnjoyPlayer-macOS-vX.Y.Z.zip` plus `latest.json` / `appcast.xml` to `dl.enjoy.bot` (S3-compatible storage).

### Optional secrets (S3 / R2 publish)

| Secret name | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | R2 or S3 access key |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | R2 or S3 secret key |
| `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3` | e.g. `https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` |
| `PUBLISH_BUCKET` | Bucket name (default in scripts: `enjoy-dl`) |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | Optional — purge CDN cache after feed upload |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` | Optional — zone for `enjoy.bot` |

Local publish (after a successful notarized build):

```bash
cp .github/scripts/publish_env.example.sh .github/scripts/publish_env.local.sh
# edit AWS_* / PUBLISH_* values
bash .github/scripts/release.sh --platform apple --publish-only --publish
```

---

## App Store review cycle (fastlane)

After TestFlight builds are healthy, the review loop is two lanes (same ASC credentials as above; no macOS-only tooling, so they also run on Linux):

```bash
# Where is the submission? (READY_FOR_REVIEW / IN_REVIEW / REJECTED / …)
bash .github/scripts/fastlane.sh ios review_status

# Fix, rebuild, re-upload to TestFlight, then submit the edited version again:
bash .github/scripts/release.sh --platform apple --ios-only --testflight --skip-build --skip-checks
APP_VERSION="$(bash .github/scripts/read_pubspec_version.sh)" \
  bash .github/scripts/fastlane.sh ios submit_review
```

`submit_review` auto-answers the export-compliance / third-party-content questionnaire and attaches the latest processed build. Rejection reasons themselves are only in App Store Connect → Resolution Center (and email) — no API exposes them, so the human read stays manual.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| *Error Downloading App Information* on IPA | Create App Store Connect app for `ai.enjoy.player` |
| *No profiles for 'ai.enjoy.player'* | Open Xcode on runner, build once with automatic signing |
| *notarytool* auth failed | Re-check API key ID, Issuer ID, and full `.p8` secret content |
| *invalidPEMDocument* when registering notary credentials | `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_PRIVATE_KEY` must be the full PEM with real newlines (including `BEGIN/END PRIVATE KEY`). Re-set with `gh secret set APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_PRIVATE_KEY < AuthKey_XXXX.p8`. Release scripts also normalize literal `\n` sequences. |
| macOS DYLD / `libz` missing | Run `brew bundle install --file=macos/Brewfile` on runner |
| TestFlight credentials missing | Set ASC API secrets (CI) or local `~/.config/enjoy-player/{asc.env,AuthKey_<KEY_ID>.p8}`. Run `verify_macos_release_env.sh`. `--testflight` fails hard when credentials are absent. |
| Build Apple jobs stuck **queued** / never start | Workflow `runs-on` labels must match the runner. Org mac runners have `self-hosted` + `macos` (lowercase) — do **not** require a custom `flutter` label unless you add it in GitHub → Settings → Actions → Runners. Agentic `self-hosted`-only jobs can occupy mac runners; cancel long-running agentic jobs if Apple CI is starved. |
| `exit code 35` during Flutter SDK download | Transient curl/HTTP2 issue — `setup-macos-runner-env` sets `CURL_HTTP_VERSION=1_1`; `setup-flutter` uses `--http1.1` on macOS/Linux downloads. |
| Xcode *Could not resolve package dependencies* (SPM) or opaque *xcodebuild encountered an error (74)* | Usually SwiftPM: flaky GitHub fetches for `GoogleSignIn` / `AppAuth`, a corrupted `~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm`, or inherited `GIT_CONFIG_*=safe.bareRepository=explicit` (Copilot). `setup-macos-runner-env` forces `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=0`; `apple_spm_hygiene.sh` serializes Apple builds on the host, clears SPM caches, and retries up to 3 times in `build_ios_ci.sh` / `build_macos_ci.sh` / `release_apple.sh`. |
| macOS smoke fails on `frameworks.zip` / `bitcode_strip` (ffmpeg_kit) | Transient GitHub release download — `packages/ffmpeg_kit_flutter_new/scripts/setup_*.sh` use `curl -fsSL --http1.1 --retry 5`. Delete `packages/ffmpeg_kit_flutter_new/{ios,macos}/Frameworks` on the runner if a partial extract is stuck, then re-run. |
| *Apple Distribution certificate missing* | Install **Apple Distribution** (team `46X685R747`) in the runner login keychain for TestFlight; **Developer ID Application** alone is not enough for iOS IPA. With ASC API secrets set, `ensure_ios_distribution_identity.sh` will create/import a fresh cert (revoking orphan portal certs that have no local private key). |
| S3 publish failed / skipped locally | Run with `--publish` and configure `publish_env.local.sh` (see [packaging.md § Publish](packaging.md#publish-to-dlenjoybot-optional)). After build-only, use `--publish-only --publish`. |
| `RELEASE_EXTRA_ARGS[@]: unbound variable` on macOS | Fixed in release scripts (Bash 3.2 + `set -u`); update to latest `main`. |

## Local release (without CI)

Prefer the shared release script (same as CI):

```bash
bash .github/scripts/verify_macos_release_env.sh
# macOS direct download only
bash .github/scripts/release.sh --platform apple --macos-only --notarize

# iOS / TestFlight only
bash .github/scripts/release.sh --platform apple --ios-only --testflight

# Full Apple release
bash .github/scripts/release.sh --platform apple --notarize --testflight
```

Manual steps (equivalent to what the script runs):

```bash
brew bundle install --file=macos/Brewfile
(cd macos && pod install)
bash .github/scripts/build_macos_release.sh
./macos/scripts/notarize_release.sh "build/macos/Build/Products/Release/Enjoy Player.app"
ditto -c -k --norsrc --keepParent "build/macos/Build/Products/Release/Enjoy Player.app" \
  "EnjoyPlayer-macOS-v$(bash .github/scripts/read_pubspec_version.sh).zip"
```

For local notarization with Apple ID instead of API key, see [packaging.md § One-time setup](packaging.md#one-time-setup).
